## What is PolarDB for PostgreSQL?

PolarDB for PostgreSQL (PolarDB for short) is an open-source database system based on PostgreSQL. It extends PostgreSQL to become a share-nothing distributed database, which supports **global data consistency** and **ACID across database nodes**, **distributed SQL processing**, and **data redundancy** and **high availability** through Paxos based replication. PolarDB is designed to add values and new features to PostgreSQL in dimensions of high performance, scalability, high availability, and elasticity. At the same time, PolarDB remains SQL compatibility to standalone PostgreSQL with the best effort.

PolarDB will evolve and offer its functions and features in two major parts: an extension and a patch to PostgreSQL. The extension part includes components implemented outside the PostgreSQL kernel, such as distributed transaction management, global or distributed time service, distributed SQL processing, additional metadata, internal functions, and tools to manage database clusters and conduct fault tolerance or recovery. Having most of its functions in a PostgreSQL extension, PolarDB targets **easy upgrading**, **easy migration**, and **fast adoption**. The patch part includes the changes necessary to the kernel, such as distributed MVCC for different isolation levels. We expect functions and codes in the patch part is limited. As a result, PolarDB can be easily upgraded with newer PostgreSQL versions and maintained full compatibility with PostgreSQL.

## Quick start with PolarDB

Three approaches are offered to quickly try out PolarDB: Alibaba Cloud service, deployment using Docker images, and deployment from source codes.

### Alibaba Cloud Service
TBD

### Deployment Using Docker Images
TBD

### One-Key Deployment

onekey.sh can be used to build, configure, deploy, start, and init a cluster of PolarDB.

* before executing onekey.sh
  - set up environment variables (LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH)
  - install dependent packages
  - set up ssh login without password

* run onekey.sh script

```bash
./onekey.sh all
```

* check running processes (leader, follower, logger), their replica roles and status:

```bash
ps -ef|grep polardb
psql -p 10001 -d postgres -c "select * from pg_stat_replication;"
psql -p 10001 -d postgres -c "select * from polar_dma_cluster_status;"
```


### Deployment from Source Code

We extend a tool named pgxc_ctl from PG-XC/PG-XL open-source project to support cluster management, such as configuration generation, configuration modification, cluster initialization, starting/stopping nodes, and switchover. Its detail usage can be found [deployment](/doc/polardb/deployment.md).

* download source code
* install dependent packages (use Centos as an example)

```bash
sudo yum install libzstd-devel libzstd zstd cmake openssl-devel protobuf-devel readline-devel libxml2-devel libxslt-devel zlib-devel bzip2-devel lz4-devel snappy-devel
```
* set up ssh login without password

Call ssh-copy-id command to configure ssh so that no password is needed when using pgxc_ctl.

```bash
ssh-copy-id username@IP
```

* build and install binary

You can just call build script to build. If you get errors, please reference [deployment](/doc/polardb/deployment.md) for detail reasons.

```bash
./build.sh
```

* set up environment variables

```bash
vi ~/.bashrc
export PATH="$HOME/polardb/polardbhome/bin:$PATH"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/polardb/polardbhome/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"ß
```

* generate default configure file

```bash
pgxc_ctl -c $HOME/polardb/polardb_paxos.conf prepare standalone
```

* deploy binary file

```bash
pgxc_ctl -c $HOME/polardb/polardb_paxos.conf deploy all
```

* clean residual installation and init cluster

```bash
pgxc_ctl -c $HOME/polardb/polardb_paxos.conf clean all
pgxc_ctl -c $HOME/polardb/polardb_paxos.conf init all
pgxc_ctl -c $HOME/polardb/polardb_paxos.conf monitor all
```

* install dependent packages for cluster management

```bash
pgxc_ctl -c $HOME/polardb/polardb_paxos.conf deploy cm
```

* start cluster or node

```bash
pgxc_ctl -c $HOME/polardb/polardb_paxos.conf start all
```

* stop cluster or node

```bash
pgxc_ctl -c $HOME/polardb/polardb_paxos.conf stop all
```

* failover datanode

datanode_1 is node name configured in polardb_paxos.conf.

```bash
pgxc_ctl -c $HOME/polardb/polardb_paxos.conf failover datanode datanode_1
```

* cluster health check

 check cluster status and start failed node.

```bash
pgxc_ctl -c $HOME/polardb/polardb_paxos.conf healthcheck all
```

* examples for other command

```bash
pgxc_ctl -c $HOME/polardb/polardb_paxos.conf kill all
pgxc_ctl -c $HOME/polardb/polardb_paxos.conf log var datanodeNames
pgxc_ctl -c $HOME/polardb/polardb_paxos.conf show configuration all
```

* check and test

```bash
ps -ef | grep postgres
psql -p 10001 -d postgres -c "create table t1(a int primary key, b int);"
createdb test -p 10001
psql -p 10001 -d test -c "select version();"
```

## Architecture & Roadmap

PolarDB uses a share-nothing architecture. Each node stores data and also executes queries, and they coordinate with each other through message passing. The architecture allows the database to be scaled by adding more nodes to the cluster.

PolarDB slices a table into shards by hashing its primary key. The number of shards is configurable. Shards are stored in PolarDB nodes. When a query accesses shards in many nodes, a distributed transaction and a transaction coordinator are used to maintain ACID across nodes.

Each shard is replicated to three nodes with each replica stored on a different node. In order to save costs, we can deploy two of the replicas to store complete data. The third replica only stores a write-ahead log (WAL), which participates in the election but cannot be chosen as the leader.
