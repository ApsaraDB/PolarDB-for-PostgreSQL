#Complete Bug List
#==================
Problem #1: closed
Summary: Q10 returns no rows
	Since orders can only be returned (l_returnflag = 'R') after they 
	have been received, and can't be received in the future, the
	number of permissible orders for query 10 tails off early in
	1995. If you are lucky enough to get a parameter substitution
	after February '95 (allowed in 2.12.3), things can go "quickly".
SEVERITY:
SPEC FIX: replace 2.12.3 (1) with "DATE is the first day in a
	rundomly selected month between the first month of 1993 and the
	last month of 1994"
DBGEN FIX: change permisible substitution range for query 10, 
	parameter 1
ANSWER SETS: not effected.
WORKAROUND: use a different seed for qgen parameter substitution
HELP NEEDED:
AUDITORS NOTIFIED:	
OPENED AGAINST: 1.0
CLOSED IN:      1.0.1 (dbgen and qgen)

Problem #2: closed
Summary: parallelism in load to gen differing data sets
the parallel load code was based on extensible data sets; since
	 each "extension" made an assumption of scale factor, the data
	 could end up clustered. Further, since the RNG is
	 self-modifying, different numbers of extension led to different
	 final data sets.
SEVERITY:
SPEC FIX: none.
DBGEN FIX: remove -E(xtensible) option and implement pure parallel
load with a known scale factor; rebuild seed files
ANSWER SETS: not effected. (parallelism not implemented for SF <= 1)
WORKAROUND: don't use the parallel load (-C) option to DBGEN
HELP NEEDED: testers needed.
AUDITORS NOTIFIED:	yes.
OPENED AGAINST:     1.0
CLOSED IN:          1.0.1

Problem #3: closed
Summary: some arithmetic tends to overflow at large SF
retailprice tends to SF/10 as SF increases. this can lead to
	 data corruption in extendedprice and aggregate calculations
SEVERITY:
SPEC FIX: will need rework of 1.3 wrt retailprice calculation
DBGEN FIX: modification to second term of rpb_routine() calcuation
to limit contibution of second term to the maximum seen at 
	       SF=.1
ANSWER SETS: not effected
WORKAROUND: code retail/extended price calculations as long long;
build smaller data sets

Problem #52: closed
Summary: qgen seeds make parameter substitutions position dependant
	The current scheme uses an individual RNG stream for each query, and seeds
	all streams identically. Accordingly, two queries that use the same domain
	for the same parameter will always have the same value (e.g., q9 and q20).

Problem #00062: closed
Summary:      bad update rollover after 1000 refreshes
    This test uses tpcH scale 0.01. We've encountered
	an situation in which dbgen doesn't generate
	the correct data for delete files delete.1000 and
	above. In particular, file delete.1000 contains
	keys to be deleted that have never been loaded.
	Because of this problem, keys that should have been
	deleted never are causing duplicate unique values
	to appear in the incremental loads after we cycle
	from the 4000th incremental update back around starting
	again with the 1st one.
