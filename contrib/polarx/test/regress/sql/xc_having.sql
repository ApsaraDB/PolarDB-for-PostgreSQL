-- this file contains tests for HAVING clause with combinations of following
-- 1. enable_hashagg = on/off (to force the grouping by sorting)
-- 2. distributed or replicated tables across the datanodes
-- If a testcase is added to any of the combinations, please check if it's
-- applicable in other combinations as well.

-- Since we are testing, the plan reduction of GROUP and AGG nodes, we should
-- disable fast query shipping
set enable_fast_query_shipping to off;
