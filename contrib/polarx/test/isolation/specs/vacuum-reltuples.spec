# Test for vacuum's handling of reltuples when pages are skipped due
# to page pins. We absolutely need to avoid setting reltuples=0 in

# Expected result in second permutation is 20 tuples rather than 21 as
# for the others, because vacuum should leave the previous result
# (from before the insert) in place.
