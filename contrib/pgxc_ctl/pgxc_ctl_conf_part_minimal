#
# Postgres-XC Configuration file for pgxc_ctl utility. 
#
# Configuration file can be specified as -c option from pgxc_ctl command.   Default is
# $PGXC_CTL_HOME/pgxc_ctl.org.
#
# This is bash script so you can make any addition for your convenience to configure
# your Postgres-XC cluster.
#
# Please understand that pgxc_ctl provides only a subset of configuration which pgxc_ctl
# provide.  Here's several several assumptions/restrictions pgxc_ctl depends on.
#
# 1) All the resources of pgxc nodes has to be owned by the same user.   Same user means
#    user with the same user name.  User ID may be different from server to server.
#    This must be specified as a variable $pgxcOwner.
#
# 2) All the servers must be reacheable via ssh without password.   It is highly recommended
#    to setup key-based authentication among all the servers.
#
# 3) All the databases in coordinator/datanode has at least one same superuser.  Pgxc_ctl
#    uses this user to connect to coordinators and datanodes.   Again, no password should
#    be used to connect.  You have many options to do this, pg_hba.conf, pg_ident.conf and
#    others.  Pgxc_ctl provides a way to configure pg_hba.conf but not pg_ident.conf.   This
#    will be implemented in the later releases.
#
# 4) Gtm master and slave can have different port to listen, while coordinator and datanode
#    slave should be assigned the same port number as master.
#
# 5) Port nuber of a coordinator slave must be the same as its master.
#
# 6) Master and slave are connected using synchronous replication.  Asynchronous replication
#    have slight (almost none) chance to bring total cluster into inconsistent state.
#    This chance is very low and may be negligible.  Support of asynchronous replication
#    may be supported in the later release.
#
# 7) Each coordinator and datanode can have only one slave each.  Cascaded replication and
#    multiple slave are not supported in the current pgxc_ctl.
#
# 8) Killing nodes may end up with IPC resource leak, such as semafor and shared memory.
#    Only listening port (socket) will be cleaned with clean command.
#
# 9) Backup and restore are not supported in pgxc_ctl at present.   This is a big task and
#    may need considerable resource.
#
#========================================================================================

#
# pgxcInstallDir variable is needed if you invoke "deploy" command from pgxc_ctl utility.
# If don't you don't need this variable.
pgxcInstallDir=$HOME/pgxc
#---- OVERALL -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
pgxcOwner=$USER		# owner of the Postgres-XC databaseo cluster.  Here, we use this
						# both as linus user and database user.  This must be
						# the super user of each coordinator and datanode.
pgxcUser=$pgxcOwner		# OS user of Postgres-XC owner

tmpDir=/tmp					# temporary dir used in XC servers
localTmpDir=$tmpDir			# temporary dir used here locally

configBackup=n					# If you want config file backup, specify y to this value.
configBackupHost=pgxc-linker	# host to backup config file
configBackupDir=$HOME/pgxc		# Backup directory
configBackupFile=pgxc_ctl.bak	# Backup file name --> Need to synchronize when original changed.

dataDirRoot=$HOME/DATA/pgxl/nodes

#---- GTM ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# GTM is mandatory.  You must have at least (and only) one GTM master in your Postgres-XC cluster.
# If GTM crashes and you need to reconfigure it, you can do it by pgxc_update_gtm command to update
# GTM master with others.   Of course, we provide pgxc_remove_gtm command to remove it.  This command
# will not stop the current GTM.  It is up to the operator.

#---- Overall -------
gtmName=gtm

#---- GTM Master -----------------------------------------------

#---- Overall ----
gtmMasterServer=localhost
gtmMasterPort=20001
gtmMasterDir=$dataDirRoot/gtm

#---- Configuration ---
gtmExtraConfig=none			# Will be added gtm.conf for both Master and Slave (done at initilization only)
gtmMasterSpecificExtraConfig=none	# Will be added to Master's gtm.conf (done at initialization only)

#---- GTM Slave -----------------------------------------------

# Because GTM is a key component to maintain database consistency, you may want to configure GTM slave
# for backup.

#---- Overall ------
gtmSlave=n					# Specify y if you configure GTM Slave.   Otherwise, GTM slave will not be configured and
							# all the following variables will be reset.
gtmSlaveName=gtmSlave
gtmSlaveServer=localhost		# value none means GTM slave is not available.  Give none if you don't configure GTM Slave.
gtmSlavePort=20002			# Not used if you don't configure GTM slave.
gtmSlaveDir=$dataDirRoot/gtm_slv	# Not used if you don't configure GTM slave.
# Please note that when you have GTM failover, then there will be no slave available until you configure the slave
# again. (pgxc_add_gtm_slave function will handle it)

#---- Configuration ----
#gtmSlaveSpecificExtraConfig=none # Will be added to Slave's gtm.conf (done at initialization only)

#---- GTM Proxy -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GTM proxy will be selected based upon which server each component runs on.
# When fails over to the slave, the slave inherits its master's gtm proxy.  It should be
# reconfigured based upon the new location.
#
# To do so, slave should be restarted.   So pg_ctl promote -> (edit postgresql.conf and recovery.conf) -> pg_ctl restart
#
# You don't have to configure GTM Proxy if you dont' configure GTM slave or you are happy if every component connects
# to GTM Master directly.  If you configure GTL slave, you must configure GTM proxy too.

						# If we find there're no valid Proxy server names (means, every servers are specified
						# as none), then gtmProxy value will be set to "n" and all the entries will be set to
