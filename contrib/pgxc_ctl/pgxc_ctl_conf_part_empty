# Postgres-XC Configuration file for pgxc_ctl utility. 
#
# Configuration file can be specified as -c option from pgxc_ctl command.   Default is
# $PGXC_CTL_HOME/pgxc_ctl.org.
#
# This is bash script so you can make any addition for your convenience to configure
# your Postgres-XC cluster.
#
# Please understand that pgxc_ctl provides only a subset of configuration which pgxc_ctl
# provide.  Here's several several assumptions/restrictions pgxc_ctl depends on.
#
# 1) All the resources of pgxc nodes has to be owned by the same user.   Same user means
#    user with the same user name.  User ID may be different from server to server.
#    This must be specified as a variable $pgxcOwner.
#
# 2) All the servers must be reacheable via ssh without password.   It is highly recommended
#    to setup key-based authentication among all the servers.
#
# 3) All the databases in coordinator/datanode has at least one same superuser.  Pgxc_ctl
#    uses this user to connect to coordinators and datanodes.   Again, no password should
#    be used to connect.  You have many options to do this, pg_hba.conf, pg_ident.conf and
#    others.  Pgxc_ctl provides a way to configure pg_hba.conf but not pg_ident.conf.   This
#    will be implemented in the later releases.
#
# 4) Port nuber of a coordinator slave must be the same as its master.
#
# 5) Master and slave are connected using synchronous replication.  Asynchronous replication
#    have slight (almost none) chance to bring total cluster into inconsistent state.
#    This chance is very low and may be negligible.  Support of asynchronous replication
#    may be supported in the later release.
#
# 6) Each coordinator and datanode can have only one slave each.  Cascaded replication and
#    multiple slave are not supported in the current pgxc_ctl.
#
# 7) Killing nodes may end up with IPC resource leak, such as semafor and shared memory.
#    Only listening port (socket) will be cleaned with clean command.
#
# 8) Backup and restore are not supported in pgxc_ctl at present.   This is a big task and
#    may need considerable resource.
