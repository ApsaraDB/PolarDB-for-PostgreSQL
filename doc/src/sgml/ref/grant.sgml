 <refsect1 id="sql-grant-description">
  <title>Description</title>

  <para>
   The <command>GRANT</command> command has two basic variants: one
   that grants privileges on a database object (table, column, view, foreign
   table, sequence, database, foreign-data wrapper, foreign server, function, procedure,
   procedural language, schema, or tablespace), and one that grants
   membership in a role.  These variants are similar in many ways, but
   they are different enough to be described separately.
  </para>

 <refsect2 id="sql-grant-description-objects">
  <title>GRANT on Database Objects</title>

  <para>
   This variant of the <command>GRANT</command> command gives specific
   privileges on a database object to
   one or more roles.  These privileges are added
   to those already granted, if any.
  </para>

  <para>
   There is also an option to grant privileges on all objects of the same
   type within one or more schemas.  This functionality is currently supported
   only for tables, sequences, functions, and procedures.  <literal>ALL
   TABLES</literal> also affects views and foreign tables, just like the
   specific-object <command>GRANT</command> command.  <literal>ALL
   FUNCTIONS</literal> also affects aggregate functions, but not procedures,
   again just like the specific-object <command>GRANT</command> command.
  </para>

  <para>
   The key word <literal>PUBLIC</literal> indicates that the
   privileges are to be granted to all roles, including those that might
   be created later.  <literal>PUBLIC</literal> can be thought of as an
   implicitly defined group that always includes all roles.
   Any particular role will have the sum
   of privileges granted directly to it, privileges granted to any role it
   is presently a member of, and privileges granted to
   <literal>PUBLIC</literal>.
  </para>

  <para>
   If <literal>WITH GRANT OPTION</literal> is specified, the recipient
   of the privilege can in turn grant it to others.  Without a grant
   option, the recipient cannot do that.  Grant options cannot be granted
   to <literal>PUBLIC</literal>.
  </para>

  <para>
   There is no need to grant privileges to the owner of an object
   (usually the user that created it),
   as the owner has all privileges by default.  (The owner could,
   however, choose to revoke some of their own privileges for safety.)
  </para>

  <para>
   The right to drop an object, or to alter its definition in any way, is
   not treated as a grantable privilege; it is inherent in the owner,
   and cannot be granted or revoked.  (However, a similar effect can be
   obtained by granting or revoking membership in the role that owns
   the object; see below.)  The owner implicitly has all grant
   options for the object, too.
  </para>

  <para>
   PostgreSQL grants default privileges on some types of objects to
   <literal>PUBLIC</literal>.  No privileges are granted to
   <literal>PUBLIC</literal> by default on
   tables,
   table columns,
   sequences,
   foreign data wrappers,
   foreign servers,
   large objects,
   schemas,
   or tablespaces.
   For other types of objects, the default privileges
   granted to <literal>PUBLIC</literal> are as follows:
   <literal>CONNECT</literal> and <literal>TEMPORARY</literal> (create
   temporary tables) privileges for databases;
   <literal>EXECUTE</literal> privilege for functions and procedures; and
   <literal>USAGE</literal> privilege for languages and data types
   (including domains).
   The object owner can, of course, <command>REVOKE</command>
   both default and  expressly granted privileges. (For maximum
   security, issue the <command>REVOKE</command> in the same transaction that
   creates the object; then there is no window in which another user
   can use the object.)
   Also, these initial default privilege settings can be changed using the
   <xref linkend="sql-alterdefaultprivileges"/>
   command.
  </para>

  <para>
   The possible privileges are:

   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
     <term><literal>SELECT</literal></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Allows <xref linkend="sql-select"/> from
       any column, or the specific columns listed, of the specified table,
       view, or sequence.
       Also allows the use of
       <xref linkend="sql-copy"/> TO.
       This privilege is also needed to reference existing column values in
       <xref linkend="sql-update"/> or
       <xref linkend="sql-delete"/>.
       For sequences, this privilege also allows the use of the
       <function>currval</function> function.
       For large objects, this privilege allows the object to be read.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term><literal>INSERT</literal></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Allows <xref linkend="sql-insert"/> of a new
       row into the specified table.  If specific columns are listed,
       only those columns may be assigned to in the <command>INSERT</command>
       command (other columns will therefore receive default values).
       Also allows <xref linkend="sql-copy"/> FROM.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term><literal>UPDATE</literal></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Allows <xref linkend="sql-update"/> of any
       column, or the specific columns listed, of the specified table.
       (In practice, any nontrivial <command>UPDATE</command> command will require
       <literal>SELECT</literal> privilege as well, since it must reference table
       columns to determine which rows to update, and/or to compute new
       values for columns.)
       <literal>SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</literal>
       and <literal>SELECT ... FOR SHARE</literal>
       also require this privilege on at least one column, in addition to the
       <literal>SELECT</literal> privilege.  For sequences, this
       privilege allows the use of the <function>nextval</function> and
       <function>setval</function> functions.
       For large objects, this privilege allows writing or truncating the
       object.
      </para>

    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term><literal>DELETE</literal></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Allows <xref linkend="sql-delete"/> of a row
       from the specified table.
       (In practice, any nontrivial <command>DELETE</command> command will require
       <literal>SELECT</literal> privilege as well, since it must reference table
       columns to determine which rows to delete.)
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term><literal>TRUNCATE</literal></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Allows <xref linkend="sql-truncate"/> on
       the specified table.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term><literal>REFERENCES</literal></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Allows creation of a foreign key constraint referencing the specified
       table, or specified column(s) of the table.  (See the
       <xref linkend="sql-createtable"/> statement.)
      </para>

    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term><literal>TRIGGER</literal></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Allows the creation of a trigger on the specified table.  (See the

      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term><literal>CREATE</literal></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       For databases, allows new schemas and publications to be created within the database.
      </para>
      <para>
       For schemas, allows new objects to be created within the schema.
       To rename an existing object, you must own the object <emphasis>and</emphasis>
       have this privilege for the containing schema.
      </para>
      <para>
       For tablespaces, allows tables, indexes, and temporary files to be
       created within the tablespace, and allows databases to be created that
       have the tablespace as their default tablespace.  (Note that revoking
       this privilege will not alter the placement of existing objects.)
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term><literal>CONNECT</literal></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Allows the user to connect to the specified database.  This
       privilege is checked at connection startup (in addition to checking
       any restrictions imposed by <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename>).
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term><literal>TEMPORARY</literal></term>
     <term><literal>TEMP</literal></term>

    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term><literal>EXECUTE</literal></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Allows the use of the specified function or procedure and the use of
       any operators that are implemented on top of the function.  This is the
       only type of privilege that is applicable to functions and procedures.
       The <literal>FUNCTION</literal> syntax also works for aggregate
       functions.  Alternatively, use <literal>ROUTINE</literal> to refer to a function,
       aggregate function, or procedure regardless of what it is.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term><literal>USAGE</literal></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       For procedural languages, allows the use of the specified language for
       the creation of functions in that language.  This is the only type
       of privilege that is applicable to procedural languages.
      </para>
      <para>
       For schemas, allows access to objects contained in the specified
       schema (assuming that the objects' own privilege requirements are
       also met).  Essentially this allows the grantee to <quote>look up</quote>
       objects within the schema.  Without this permission, it is still
       possible to see the object names, e.g. by querying the system tables.
       Also, after revoking this permission, existing backends might have
       statements that have previously performed this lookup, so this is not
       a completely secure way to prevent object access.
      </para>
      <para>
       For sequences, this privilege allows the use of the
       <function>currval</function> and <function>nextval</function> functions.
      </para>
      <para>
       For types and domains, this privilege allows the use of the type or
       domain in the creation of tables, functions, and other schema objects.
       (Note that it does not control general <quote>usage</quote> of the type,
       such as values of the type appearing in queries.  It only prevents
       objects from being created that depend on the type.  The main purpose of
       the privilege is controlling which users create dependencies on a type,
       which could prevent the owner from changing the type later.)
      </para>
      <para>
       For foreign-data wrappers, this privilege allows creation of
       new servers using the foreign-data wrapper.
      </para>
      <para>
       For servers, this privilege allows creation of foreign tables using
       the server.  Grantees may also create, alter, or drop their own
       user mappings associated with that server.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term><literal>ALL PRIVILEGES</literal></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Grant all of the available privileges at once.
       The <literal>PRIVILEGES</literal> key word is optional in
       <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>, though it is required by
       strict SQL.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

   The privileges required by other commands are listed on the
   reference page of the respective command.
  </para>
 </refsect2>

 <refsect2 id="sql-grant-description-roles">
  <title>GRANT on Roles</title>

  <para>
   This variant of the <command>GRANT</command> command grants membership
   in a role to one or more other roles.  Membership in a role is significant
   because it conveys the privileges granted to a role to each of its
   members.
  </para>

  <para>
   If <literal>WITH ADMIN OPTION</literal> is specified, the member can
   in turn grant membership in the role to others, and revoke membership
   in the role as well.  Without the admin option, ordinary users cannot
   do that.  A role is not considered to hold <literal>WITH ADMIN
   OPTION</literal> on itself, but it may grant or revoke membership in
   itself from a database session where the session user matches the
   role.  Database superusers can grant or revoke membership in any role
   to anyone.  Roles having <literal>CREATEROLE</literal> privilege can grant
   or revoke membership in any role that is not a superuser.
  </para>

  <para>
   Unlike the case with privileges, membership in a role cannot be granted
   to <literal>PUBLIC</literal>.  Note also that this form of the command does not
   allow the noise word <literal>GROUP</literal>.

 </refsect1>


 <refsect1 id="sql-grant-notes">
  <title>Notes</title>

   <para>
    The <xref linkend="sql-revoke"/> command is used
    to revoke access privileges.
   </para>

   <para>
    Since <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> 8.1, the concepts of users and
    groups have been unified into a single kind of entity called a role.
    It is therefore no longer necessary to use the keyword <literal>GROUP</literal>
    to identify whether a grantee is a user or a group.  <literal>GROUP</literal>
    is still allowed in the command, but it is a noise word.
   </para>

   <para>
    A user may perform <command>SELECT</command>, <command>INSERT</command>, etc. on a
    column if they hold that privilege for either the specific column or
    its whole table.  Granting the privilege at the table level and then
    revoking it for one column will not do what one might wish: the
    table-level grant is unaffected by a column-level operation.
   </para>

   <para>
    When a non-owner of an object attempts to <command>GRANT</command> privileges
    on the object, the command will fail outright if the user has no
    privileges whatsoever on the object.  As long as some privilege is
    available, the command will proceed, but it will grant only those
    privileges for which the user has grant options.  The <command>GRANT ALL
    PRIVILEGES</command> forms will issue a warning message if no grant options are
    held, while the other forms will issue a warning if grant options for
    any of the privileges specifically named in the command are not held.
    (In principle these statements apply to the object owner as well, but
    since the owner is always treated as holding all grant options, the
    cases can never occur.)
   </para>

   <para>
    It should be noted that database superusers can access
    all objects regardless of object privilege settings.  This
    is comparable to the rights of <literal>root</literal> in a Unix system.
    As with <literal>root</literal>, it's unwise to operate as a superuser
    except when absolutely necessary.
   </para>

   <para>
    If a superuser chooses to issue a <command>GRANT</command> or <command>REVOKE</command>
    command, the command is performed as though it were issued by the
    owner of the affected object.  In particular, privileges granted via
    such a command will appear to have been granted by the object owner.
    (For role membership, the membership appears to have been granted
    by the containing role itself.)
   </para>

   <para>
    <command>GRANT</command> and <command>REVOKE</command> can also be done by a role
    that is not the owner of the affected object, but is a member of the role
    that owns the object, or is a member of a role that holds privileges
    <literal>WITH GRANT OPTION</literal> on the object.  In this case the
    privileges will be recorded as having been granted by the role that
    actually owns the object or holds the privileges
    <literal>WITH GRANT OPTION</literal>.  For example, if table
    <literal>t1</literal> is owned by role <literal>g1</literal>, of which role
    <literal>u1</literal> is a member, then <literal>u1</literal> can grant privileges
    on <literal>t1</literal> to <literal>u2</literal>, but those privileges will appear
    to have been granted directly by <literal>g1</literal>.  Any other member
    of role <literal>g1</literal> could revoke them later.
   </para>

   <para>
    If the role executing <command>GRANT</command> holds the required privileges
    indirectly via more than one role membership path, it is unspecified
    which containing role will be recorded as having done the grant.  In such
    cases it is best practice to use <command>SET ROLE</command> to become the
    specific role you want to do the <command>GRANT</command> as.
   </para>

   <para>
    Granting permission on a table does not automatically extend
    permissions to any sequences used by the table, including
    sequences tied to <type>SERIAL</type> columns.  Permissions on
    sequences must be set separately.
   </para>

   <para>
    Use <xref linkend="app-psql"/>'s <command>\dp</command> command
    to obtain information about existing privileges for tables and
    columns.  For example:
<programlisting>
=&gt; \dp mytable
                              Access privileges
 Schema |  Name   | Type  |   Access privileges   | Column access privileges 
--------+---------+-------+-----------------------+--------------------------
 public | mytable | table | miriam=arwdDxt/miriam | col1:
                          : =r/miriam             :   miriam_rw=rw/miriam
                          : admin=arw/miriam        
(1 row)
</programlisting>
    The entries shown by <command>\dp</command> are interpreted thus:
<literallayout class="monospaced">
rolename=xxxx -- privileges granted to a role
        =xxxx -- privileges granted to PUBLIC

            r -- SELECT ("read")
            w -- UPDATE ("write")
            a -- INSERT ("append")
            d -- DELETE
            D -- TRUNCATE
            x -- REFERENCES
            t -- TRIGGER
            X -- EXECUTE
            U -- USAGE
            C -- CREATE
            c -- CONNECT
            T -- TEMPORARY
      arwdDxt -- ALL PRIVILEGES (for tables, varies for other objects)
            * -- grant option for preceding privilege

        /yyyy -- role that granted this privilege
</literallayout>

    The above example display would be seen by user <literal>miriam</literal> after
    creating table <literal>mytable</literal> and doing:

<programlisting>
GRANT SELECT ON mytable TO PUBLIC;
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT ON mytable TO admin;
GRANT SELECT (col1), UPDATE (col1) ON mytable TO miriam_rw;
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    For non-table objects there are other <command>\d</command> commands
    that can display their privileges.
   </para>

   <para>
    If the <quote>Access privileges</quote> column is empty for a given object,
    it means the object has default privileges (that is, its privileges column
    is null).  Default privileges always include all privileges for the owner,
    and can include some privileges for <literal>PUBLIC</literal> depending on the
    object type, as explained above.  The first <command>GRANT</command> or
    <command>REVOKE</command> on an object
    will instantiate the default privileges (producing, for example,
    <literal>{miriam=arwdDxt/miriam}</literal>) and then modify them per the
    specified request.  Similarly, entries are shown in <quote>Column access
    privileges</quote> only for columns with nondefault privileges.
    (Note: for this purpose, <quote>default privileges</quote> always means the
    built-in default privileges for the object's type.  An object whose
    privileges have been affected by an <command>ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES</command>
    command will always be shown with an explicit privilege entry that
    includes the effects of the <command>ALTER</command>.)
   </para>

   <para>
    Notice that the owner's implicit grant options are not marked in the

   Grant insert privilege to all users on table <literal>films</literal>:

<programlisting>
GRANT INSERT ON films TO PUBLIC;
</programlisting>

   Grant all available privileges to user <literal>manuel</literal> on view
   <literal>kinds</literal>:

<programlisting>
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON kinds TO manuel;

   Note that while the above will indeed grant all privileges if executed by a
   superuser or the owner of <literal>kinds</literal>, when executed by someone
   else it will only grant those permissions for which the someone else has
   grant options.

   <para>
    According to the SQL standard, the <literal>PRIVILEGES</literal>
    key word in <literal>ALL PRIVILEGES</literal> is required.  The
    SQL standard does not support setting the privileges on more than
    one object per command.
   </para>

   <para>
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> allows an object owner to revoke their
    own ordinary privileges: for example, a table owner can make the table
    read-only to themselves by revoking their own <literal>INSERT</literal>,
    <literal>UPDATE</literal>, <literal>DELETE</literal>, and <literal>TRUNCATE</literal>
    privileges.  This is not possible according to the SQL standard.  The
    reason is that <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> treats the owner's
    privileges as having been granted by the owner to themselves; therefore they
    can revoke them too.  In the SQL standard, the owner's privileges are
    granted by an assumed entity <quote>_SYSTEM</quote>.  Not being
    <quote>_SYSTEM</quote>, the owner cannot revoke these rights.
   </para>

   <para>
    According to the SQL standard, grant options can be granted to
    <literal>PUBLIC</literal>; PostgreSQL only supports granting grant options
    to roles.
   </para>

   <para>
    The SQL standard provides for a <literal>USAGE</literal> privilege
    on other kinds of objects: character sets, collations,
    translations.
   </para>

   <para>
    In the SQL standard, sequences only have a <literal>USAGE</literal>
    privilege, which controls the use of the <literal>NEXT VALUE FOR</literal>
    expression, which is equivalent to the
    function <function>nextval</function> in PostgreSQL.  The sequence
    privileges <literal>SELECT</literal> and <literal>UPDATE</literal> are
    PostgreSQL extensions.  The application of the
    sequence <literal>USAGE</literal> privilege to
    the <literal>currval</literal> function is also a PostgreSQL extension (as
    is the function itself).
   </para>

   <para>
    Privileges on databases, tablespaces, schemas, and languages are
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> extensions.
