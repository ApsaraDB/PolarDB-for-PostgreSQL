  <para>
   PostgreSQL provides infrastructure to stream the modifications performed
   via SQL to external consumers.  This functionality can be used for a
   variety of purposes, including replication solutions and auditing.
  </para>

  <para>
   Changes are sent out in streams identified by logical replication slots.
  </para>

  <para>
   The format in which those changes are streamed is determined by the output
   plugin used.  An example plugin is provided in the PostgreSQL distribution.
   Additional plugins can be
   written to extend the choice of available formats without modifying any
   core code.
   Every output plugin has access to each individual new row produced
   by <command>INSERT</command> and the new row version created
   by <command>UPDATE</command>.  Availability of old row versions for
   <command>UPDATE</command> and <command>DELETE</command> depends on
   the configured replica identity (see <xref linkend="sql-createtable-replica-identity"/>).
  </para>

  <para>
   Changes can be consumed either using the streaming replication protocol
   (see <xref linkend="protocol-replication"/> and
   <xref linkend="logicaldecoding-walsender"/>), or by calling functions
   via SQL (see <xref linkend="logicaldecoding-sql"/>). It is also possible
   to write additional methods of consuming the output of a replication slot
   without modifying core code
   (see <xref linkend="logicaldecoding-writer"/>).

   <para>
    The following example demonstrates controlling logical decoding using the
    SQL interface.
   </para>

   <para>
    Before you can use logical decoding, you must set
    <xref linkend="guc-wal-level"/> to <literal>logical</literal> and
    <xref linkend="guc-max-replication-slots"/> to at least 1.  Then, you
    should connect to the target database (in the example
    below, <literal>postgres</literal>) as a superuser.

    The following example shows how logical decoding is controlled over the
    streaming replication protocol, using the
    program <xref linkend="app-pgrecvlogical"/> included in the PostgreSQL
    distribution.  This requires that client authentication is set up to allow
    replication connections
    (see <xref linkend="streaming-replication-authentication"/>) and
    that <varname>max_wal_senders</varname> is set sufficiently high to allow
    an additional connection.

    </indexterm>

    <para>
     Logical decoding is the process of extracting all persistent changes
     to a database's tables into a coherent, easy to understand format which
     can be interpreted without detailed knowledge of the database's internal
     state.
    </para>

    <para>
     In <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>, logical decoding is implemented
     by decoding the contents of the <link linkend="wal">write-ahead
     log</link>, which describe changes on a storage level, into an
     application-specific form such as a stream of tuples or SQL statements.

    </indexterm>

    <para>
     In the context of logical replication, a slot represents a stream of
     changes that can be replayed to a client in the order they were made on
     the origin server. Each slot streams a sequence of changes from a single
     database.
    </para>

    <note>
     <para><productname>PostgreSQL</productname> also has streaming replication slots
     (see <xref linkend="streaming-replication"/>), but they are used somewhat
     differently there.
     </para>
    </note>

    <para>
     A replication slot has an identifier that is unique across all databases
     in a <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> cluster. Slots persist
     independently of the connection using them and are crash-safe.
    </para>

    <para>
     A logical slot will emit each change just once in normal operation.
     The current position of each slot is persisted only at checkpoint, so in
     the case of a crash the slot may return to an earlier LSN, which will
     then cause recent changes to be resent when the server restarts.
     Logical decoding clients are responsible for avoiding ill effects from
     handling the same message more than once.  Clients may wish to record
     the last LSN they saw when decoding and skip over any repeated data or
     (when using the replication protocol) request that decoding start from
     that LSN rather than letting the server determine the start point.
     The Replication Progress Tracking feature is designed for this purpose,
     refer to <link linkend="replication-origins">replication origins</link>.
    </para>

    <para>
     Multiple independent slots may exist for a single database. Each slot has
     its own state, allowing different consumers to receive changes from
     different points in the database change stream. For most applications, a
     separate slot will be required for each consumer.
    </para>

    <para>
     A logical replication slot knows nothing about the state of the
     receiver(s).  It's even possible to have multiple different receivers using
     the same slot at different times; they'll just get the changes following
     on from when the last receiver stopped consuming them. Only one receiver
     may consume changes from a slot at any given time.
    </para>

    <caution>
     <para>
      Replication slots persist across crashes and know nothing about the state
      of their consumer(s). They will prevent removal of required resources
      even when there is no connection using them. This consumes storage
      because neither required WAL nor required rows from the system catalogs
      can be removed by <command>VACUUM</command> as long as they are required by a replication
      slot.  In extreme cases this could cause the database to shut down to prevent
      transaction ID wraparound (see <xref linkend="vacuum-for-wraparound"/>).
      So if a slot is no longer required it should be dropped.
     </para>
    </caution>

   <sect2>
    <title>Output Plugins</title>
    <para>
     Output plugins transform the data from the write-ahead log's internal
     representation into the format the consumer of a replication slot desires.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>Exported Snapshots</title>
    <para>
     When a new replication slot is created using the streaming replication
     interface (see <xref linkend="protocol-replication-create-slot"/>), a
     snapshot is exported
     (see <xref linkend="functions-snapshot-synchronization"/>), which will show
     exactly the state of the database after which all changes will be
     included in the change stream. This can be used to create a new replica by
     using <link linkend="sql-set-transaction"><literal>SET TRANSACTION
     SNAPSHOT</literal></link> to read the state of the database at the moment
     the slot was created. This transaction can then be used to dump the
     database's state at that point in time, which afterwards can be updated
     using the slot's contents without losing any changes.
    </para>
    <para>
     Creation of a snapshot is not always possible.  In particular, it will
     fail when connected to a hot standby.  Applications that do not require
     snapshot export may suppress it with the <literal>NOEXPORT_SNAPSHOT</literal>
     option.

    <para>
     An output plugin is loaded by dynamically loading a shared library with
     the output plugin's name as the library base name. The normal library
     search path is used to locate the library. To provide the required output
     plugin callbacks and to indicate that the library is actually an output
     plugin it needs to provide a function named
     <function>_PG_output_plugin_init</function>. This function is passed a
     struct that needs to be filled with the callback function pointers for
     individual actions.

    <title>Capabilities</title>

    <para>
     To decode, format and output changes, output plugins can use most of the
     backend's normal infrastructure, including calling output functions. Read
     only access to relations is permitted as long as only relations are
     accessed that either have been created by <command>initdb</command> in
     the <literal>pg_catalog</literal> schema, or have been marked as user
     provided catalog tables using
<programlisting>
ALTER TABLE user_catalog_table SET (user_catalog_table = true);
CREATE TABLE another_catalog_table(data text) WITH (user_catalog_table = true);
</programlisting>
     Any actions leading to transaction ID assignment are prohibited. That, among others,
     includes writing to tables, performing DDL changes, and
     calling <literal>txid_current()</literal>.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="logicaldecoding-output-mode">
    <title>Output Modes</title>

    <para>
     Output plugin callbacks can pass data to the consumer in nearly arbitrary
     formats. For some use cases, like viewing the changes via SQL, returning
     data in a data type that can contain arbitrary data (e.g., <type>bytea</type>) is
     cumbersome. If the output plugin only outputs textual data in the
     server's encoding, it can declare that by
     setting <literal>OutputPluginOptions.output_type</literal>
     to <literal>OUTPUT_PLUGIN_TEXTUAL_OUTPUT</literal> instead
     of <literal>OUTPUT_PLUGIN_BINARY_OUTPUT</literal> in
     the <link linkend="logicaldecoding-output-plugin-startup">startup
     callback</link>. In that case, all the data has to be in the server's encoding
     so that a <type>text</type> datum can contain it. This is checked in assertion-enabled
     builds.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="logicaldecoding-output-plugin-callbacks">
    <title>Output Plugin Callbacks</title>

    <para>
     An output plugin gets notified about changes that are happening via
     various callbacks it needs to provide.
    </para>

    <para>
     Concurrent transactions are decoded in commit order, and only changes
     belonging to a specific transaction are decoded between
     the <literal>begin</literal> and <literal>commit</literal>
     callbacks. Transactions that were rolled back explicitly or implicitly
     never get
     decoded. Successful savepoints are
     folded into the transaction containing them in the order they were
     executed within that transaction.
    </para>

    <note>
     <para>
      Only transactions that have already safely been flushed to disk will be
      decoded. That can lead to a <command>COMMIT</command> not immediately being decoded in a
      directly following <literal>pg_logical_slot_get_changes()</literal>

                                       ReorderBufferChange *change);
</programlisting>
      The <parameter>ctx</parameter> and <parameter>txn</parameter> parameters
      have the same contents as for the <function>begin_cb</function>
      and <function>commit_cb</function> callbacks, but additionally the
      relation descriptor <parameter>relation</parameter> points to the
      relation the row belongs to and a struct
      <parameter>change</parameter> describing the row modification are passed
      in.

       Only changes in user defined tables that are not unlogged

    <sect3 id="logicaldecoding-output-plugin-truncate">
     <title>Truncate Callback</title>

     <para>
      The <function>truncate_cb</function> callback is called for a
      <command>TRUNCATE</command> command.
<programlisting>
typedef void (*LogicalDecodeTruncateCB) (struct LogicalDecodingContext *ctx,
                                         ReorderBufferTXN *txn,
                                         int nrelations,
                                         Relation relations[],
                                         ReorderBufferChange *change);
</programlisting>
      The parameters are analogous to the <function>change_cb</function>
      callback.  However, because <command>TRUNCATE</command> actions on
      tables connected by foreign keys need to be executed together, this
      callback receives an array of relations instead of just a single one.
      See the description of the <xref linkend="sql-truncate"/> statement for
      details.
     </para>
    </sect3>

     <sect3 id="logicaldecoding-output-plugin-filter-origin">
     <title>Origin Filter Callback</title>

     <para>
       The optional <function>filter_by_origin_cb</function> callback
       is called to determine whether data that has been replayed
       from <parameter>origin_id</parameter> is of interest to the
       output plugin.
<programlisting>
typedef bool (*LogicalDecodeFilterByOriginCB) (struct LogicalDecodingContext *ctx,
                                               RepOriginId origin_id);
</programlisting>
      The <parameter>ctx</parameter> parameter has the same contents
      as for the other callbacks. No information but the origin is
      available. To signal that changes originating on the passed in
      node are irrelevant, return true, causing them to be filtered
      away; false otherwise. The other callbacks will not be called
      for transactions and changes that have been filtered away.
     </para>
     <para>
       This is useful when implementing cascading or multidirectional
       replication solutions. Filtering by the origin allows to
       prevent replicating the same changes back and forth in such
       setups.  While transactions and changes also carry information
       about the origin, filtering via this callback is noticeably
       more efficient.
     </para>

    <sect3 id="logicaldecoding-output-plugin-message">
     <title>Generic Message Callback</title>

     <para>
      The optional <function>message_cb</function> callback is called whenever
      a logical decoding message has been decoded.
<programlisting>
typedef void (*LogicalDecodeMessageCB) (struct LogicalDecodingContext *ctx,
                                        ReorderBufferTXN *txn,
                                        XLogRecPtr message_lsn,
                                        bool transactional,
                                        const char *prefix,
                                        Size message_size,
                                        const char *message);
</programlisting>
      The <parameter>txn</parameter> parameter contains meta information about
      the transaction, like the time stamp at which it has been committed and
      its XID. Note however that it can be NULL when the message is
      non-transactional and the XID was not assigned yet in the transaction
      which logged the message. The <parameter>lsn</parameter> has WAL
      location of the message. The <parameter>transactional</parameter> says
      if the message was sent as transactional or not.
      The <parameter>prefix</parameter> is arbitrary null-terminated prefix
      which can be used for identifying interesting messages for the current
      plugin. And finally the <parameter>message</parameter> parameter holds
      the actual message of <parameter>message_size</parameter> size.
     </para>
     <para>
      Extra care should be taken to ensure that the prefix the output plugin
      considers interesting is unique. Using name of the extension or the
      output plugin itself is often a good choice.

    <title>Functions for Producing Output</title>

    <para>
     To actually produce output, output plugins can write data to
     the <literal>StringInfo</literal> output buffer
     in <literal>ctx-&gt;out</literal> when inside
     the <function>begin_cb</function>, <function>commit_cb</function>,
     or <function>change_cb</function> callbacks. Before writing to the output
     buffer, <function>OutputPluginPrepareWrite(ctx, last_write)</function> has
     to be called, and after finishing writing to the
     buffer, <function>OutputPluginWrite(ctx, last_write)</function> has to be
     called to perform the write. The <parameter>last_write</parameter>
     indicates whether a particular write was the callback's last write.
    </para>

    <para>
     The following example shows how to output data to the consumer of an
     output plugin:
<programlisting>
OutputPluginPrepareWrite(ctx, true);
appendStringInfo(ctx->out, "BEGIN %u", txn->xid);
OutputPluginWrite(ctx, true);

  <sect1 id="logicaldecoding-writer">
   <title>Logical Decoding Output Writers</title>

   <para>
    It is possible to add more output methods for logical decoding.
    For details, see
    <filename>src/backend/replication/logical/logicalfuncs.c</filename>.
    Essentially, three functions need to be provided: one to read WAL, one to
    prepare writing output, and one to write the output
    (see <xref linkend="logicaldecoding-output-plugin-output"/>).

  <sect1 id="logicaldecoding-synchronous">
   <title>Synchronous Replication Support for Logical Decoding</title>

   <para>
    Logical decoding can be used to build
    <link linkend="synchronous-replication">synchronous
    replication</link> solutions with the same user interface as synchronous
    replication for <link linkend="streaming-replication">streaming
    replication</link>.  To do this, the streaming replication interface
    (see <xref linkend="logicaldecoding-walsender"/>) must be used to stream out
    data. Clients have to send <literal>Standby status update (F)</literal>
    (see <xref linkend="protocol-replication"/>) messages, just like streaming
    replication clients do.
   </para>

   <note>
    <para>
     A synchronous replica receiving changes via logical decoding will work in
     the scope of a single database. Since, in contrast to
     that, <parameter>synchronous_standby_names</parameter> currently is
     server wide, this means this technique will not work properly if more
     than one database is actively used.
