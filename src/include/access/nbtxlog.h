/*
 * On insert with split, we save all the items going into the right sibling
 * so that we can restore it completely from the log record.  This way takes
 * less xlog space than the normal approach, because if we did it standardly,
 * XLogInsert would almost always think the right page is new and store its
 * whole page image.  The left page, however, is handled in the normal
 * incremental-update fashion.
 *
 * Note: the four XLOG_BTREE_SPLIT xl_info codes all use this data record.
 * The _L and _R variants indicate whether the inserted tuple went into the
 * left or right split page (and thus, whether the new item is stored or not).
 * The _HIGHKEY variants indicate that we've logged explicitly left page high
 * key value, otherwise redo should use right page leftmost key as a left page
 * high key.  _HIGHKEY is specified for internal pages where right page
 * leftmost key is suppressed, and for leaf pages of covering indexes where
 * high key have non-key attributes truncated.
 *
 * Backup Blk 0: original page / new left page
 *
 * The left page's data portion contains the new item, if it's the _L variant.
 * (In the _R variants, the new item is one of the right page's tuples.)
 * If level > 0, an IndexTuple representing the HIKEY of the left page
 * follows.  We don't need this on leaf pages, because it's the same as the
 * leftmost key in the new right page.
 *
 * Backup Blk 1: new right page
 *
 * The right page's data portion contains the right page's tuples in the
 * form used by _bt_restore_page.

 * Backup Blk 3: child's left sibling, if non-leaf split
