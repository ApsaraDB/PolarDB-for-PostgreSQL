 *
 * indexqualorig is an implicitly-ANDed list of index qual expressions, each
 * in the same form it appeared in the query WHERE condition.  Each should
 * be of the form (indexkey OP comparisonval) or (comparisonval OP indexkey).
 * The indexkey is a Var or expression referencing column(s) of the index's
 * base table.  The comparisonval might be any expression, but it won't use
 * any columns of the base table.  The expressions are ordered by index
 * column position (but items referencing the same index column can appear
 * in any order).  indexqualorig is used at runtime only if we have to recheck
 * a lossy indexqual.
 *
 * indexqual has the same form, but the expressions have been commuted if
 * necessary to put the indexkeys on the left, and the indexkeys are replaced
 * by Var nodes identifying the index columns (their varno is INDEX_VAR and
 * their varattno is the index column number).
 *
 * indexorderbyorig is similarly the original form of any ORDER BY expressions
 * that are being implemented by the index, while indexorderby is modified to
 * have index column Vars on the left-hand side.  Here, multiple expressions
 * must appear in exactly the ORDER BY order, and this is not necessarily the
 * index column order.  Only the expressions are provided, not the auxiliary
 * sort-order information from the ORDER BY SortGroupClauses; it's assumed
 * that the sort ordering is fully determinable from the top-level operators.
 * indexorderbyorig is used at runtime to recheck the ordering, if the index
 * cannot calculate an accurate ordering.  It is also needed for EXPLAIN.
 *
 * indexorderbyops is a list of the OIDs of the operators used to sort the
 * ORDER BY expressions.  This is used together with indexorderbyorig to
 * recheck ordering at run time.  (Note that indexorderby, indexorderbyorig,
 * and indexorderbyops are used for amcanorderbyop cases, not amcanorder.)
 *
 * indexorderdir specifies the scan ordering, for indexscans on amcanorder
 * indexes (for other indexes it should be "don't care").

 *		index-only scan node
 *
 * IndexOnlyScan is very similar to IndexScan, but it specifies an
 * index-only scan, in which the data comes from the index not the heap.
 * Because of this, *all* Vars in the plan node's targetlist, qual, and
 * index expressions reference index columns and have varno = INDEX_VAR.
 *
 * We could almost use indexqual directly against the index's output tuple
 * when rechecking lossy index operators, but that won't work for quals on
 * index columns that are not retrievable.  Hence, recheckqual is needed
 * for rechecks: it expresses the same condition as indexqual, but using
 * only index columns that are retrievable.  (We will not generate an
 * index-only scan if this is not possible.  An example is that if an
 * index has table column "x" in a retrievable index column "ind1", plus
 * an expression f(x) in a non-retrievable column "ind2", an indexable
 * query on f(x) will use "ind2" in indexqual and f(ind1) in recheckqual.
 * Without the "ind1" column, an index-only scan would be disallowed.)
 *
 * We don't currently need a recheckable equivalent of indexorderby,
 * because we don't support lossy operators in index ORDER BY.
 *
 * To help EXPLAIN interpret the index Vars for display, we provide
 * indextlist, which represents the contents of the index as a targetlist
 * with one TLE per index column.  Vars appearing in this list reference
 * the base table, and this is the only field in the plan node that may
 * contain such Vars.  Also, for the convenience of setrefs.c, TLEs in
 * indextlist are marked as resjunk if they correspond to columns that
 * the index AM cannot reconstruct.

 * rowtype of the foreign table, which is the normal case for a simple foreign
 * table scan.  (If the plan node represents a foreign join, fdw_scan_tlist
 * is required since there is no rowtype available from the system catalogs.)
 * When fdw_scan_tlist is provided, Vars in the node's tlist and quals must
 * have varno INDEX_VAR, and their varattnos correspond to resnos in the
 * fdw_scan_tlist (which are also column numbers in the actual scan tuple).
 * fdw_scan_tlist is never actually executed; it just holds expression trees
 * describing what is in the scan tuple's columns.
 *
 * fdw_recheck_quals should contain any quals which the core system passed to
 * the FDW but which were not added to scan.plan.qual; that is, it should
 * contain the quals being checked remotely.  This is needed for correct
 * behavior during EvalPlanQual rechecks.
 *
 * When the plan node represents a foreign join, scan.scanrelid is zero and
 * fs_relids must be consulted to identify the join relation.  (fs_relids
 * is valid for simple scans as well, but will always match scan.scanrelid.)
 * fs_relids includes outer joins; fs_base_relids does not.
 *
 * If the FDW's PlanDirectModify() callback decides to repurpose a ForeignScan
 * node to perform the UPDATE or DELETE operation directly in the remote
 * server, it sets 'operation' and 'resultRelation' to identify the operation
 * type and target relation.  Note that these fields are only set if the

 * driven by a local ModifyTable node and 'operation' is left to CMD_SELECT.

 * report support for late locking.  For other foreign tables, any locking
 * that might be done for such requests must happen during the initial row
 * fetch; their FDWs provide no mechanism for going back to lock a row later.
 * This means that the semantics will be a bit different than for a local

 * locally, since remote rows will be locked even if they then fail
 * locally-checked restriction or join quals.  However, the prospect of
 * doing a separate remote query to lock each selected row is usually pretty
 * unappealing, so early locking remains a credible design choice for FDWs.
 *
 * When doing UPDATE/DELETE/MERGE/SELECT FOR UPDATE/SHARE, we have to uniquely
 * identify all the source rows, not only those from the target relations, so
 * that we can perform EvalPlanQual rechecking at need.  For plain tables we
 * can just fetch the TID, much as for a target relation; this case is
 * represented by ROW_MARK_REFERENCE.  Otherwise (for example for VALUES or
 * FUNCTION scans) we have to copy the whole row value.  ROW_MARK_COPY is
 * pretty inefficient, since most of the time we'll never need the data; but
 * fortunately the overhead is usually not performance-critical in practice.
 * By default we use ROW_MARK_COPY for foreign tables, but if the FDW has
 * a concept of rowid it can request to use ROW_MARK_REFERENCE instead.
 * (Again, this probably doesn't make sense if a physical remote fetch is
 * needed, but for FDWs that map to local storage it might be credible.)

 * are not specified as FOR UPDATE/SHARE are marked ROW_MARK_REFERENCE (if
 * regular tables or supported foreign tables) or ROW_MARK_COPY (if not).
 *
 * Initially all PlanRowMarks have rti == prti and isParent == false.
 * When the planner discovers that a relation is the root of an inheritance
 * tree, it sets isParent true, and adds an additional PlanRowMark to the
 * list for each child relation (including the target rel itself in its role
 * as a child, if it is not a partitioned table).  Any non-leaf partitioned
 * child relations will also have entries with isParent = true.  The child
 * entries have rti == child rel's RT index and prti == top parent's RT index,
 * and can therefore be recognized as children by the fact that prti != rti.
 * The parent's allMarkTypes field gets the OR of (1<<markType) across all
 * its children (this definition allows children to use different markTypes).
 *
 * The planner also adds resjunk output columns to the plan that carry
 * information sufficient to identify the locked or fetched rows.  When
 * markType != ROW_MARK_COPY, these columns are named
 *		tableoid%u			OID of table
 *		ctid%u				TID of row
 * The tableoid column is only present for an inheritance hierarchy.
 * When markType == ROW_MARK_COPY, there is instead a single column named
 *		wholerow%u			whole-row value of relation
 * (An inheritance hierarchy could have all three resjunk output columns,
 * if some children use a different markType than others.)
 * In all three cases, %u represents the rowmark ID number (rowmarkId).
 * This number is unique within a plan tree, except that child relation
 * entries copy their parent's rowmarkId.  (Assigning unique numbers
 * means we needn't renumber rowmarkIds when flattening subqueries, which
 * would require finding and renaming the resjunk columns as well.)
 * Note this means that all tables in an inheritance hierarchy share the

 * PartitionDesc.  For a leaf partition p, subplan_map[p] contains the
 * zero-based index of the partition's subplan in the parent plan's subplan
 * list; it is -1 if the partition is non-leaf or has been pruned.  For a
 * non-leaf partition p, subpart_map[p] contains the zero-based index of that
 * sub-partition's PartitionedRelPruneInfo in the hierarchy's
 * PartitionedRelPruneInfo list; it is -1 if the partition is a leaf or has
 * been pruned.  leafpart_rti_map[p] contains the RT index of a leaf partition
 * if its subplan is in the parent plan' subplan list; it is 0 either if the
 * partition is non-leaf or it is leaf but has been pruned during planning.
 * Note that subplan indexes, as stored in 'subplan_map', are global across the
 * parent plan node, but partition indexes are valid only within a particular
 * hierarchy.  relid_map[p] contains the partition's OID, or 0 if the partition
 * was pruned.

 * strategy of the operator in the clause matched to the last partition key.
 * 'exprs' contains expressions which comprise the lookup key to be passed to
 * the partition bound search function.  'cmpfns' contains the OIDs of
 * comparison functions used to compare aforementioned expressions with
 * partition bounds.  Both 'exprs' and 'cmpfns' contain the same number of
 * items, up to partnatts items.
 *
 * Once we find the offset of a partition bound using the lookup key, we
 * determine which partitions to include in the result based on the value of
 * 'opstrategy'.  For example, if it were equality, we'd return just the
 * partition that would contain that key or a set of partitions if the key
 * didn't consist of all partitioning columns.  For non-equality strategies,
 * we'd need to include other partitions as appropriate.
 *
 * 'nullkeys' is the set containing the offset of the partition keys (0 to
 * partnatts - 1) that were matched to an IS NULL clause.  This is only
 * considered for hash partitioning as we need to pass which keys are null
 * to the hash partition bound search function.  It is never possible to
 * have an expression be present in 'exprs' for a given partition key and
 * the corresponding bit set in 'nullkeys'.
