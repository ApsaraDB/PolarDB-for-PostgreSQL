/* An item in a tuple-chunk list.  Chunk data is just a sequence of bytes.
* A "tuple-chunk" struct doesn't make sense for several reasons:
*	- The struct would need to be packed, not word-aligned, to keep from
*	  sending too much stuff.  This can be tricky to achieve across various
*	  compilers.
*	- Multi-byte integers need to be transmitted in network byte order, which
*	  may not match hardware byte order.
* Therefore, it's just a chunk of bytes in the tuple-chunk list items.
