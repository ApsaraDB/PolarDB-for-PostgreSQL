 *
 * filemap.c
 *	  A data structure for keeping track of files that have changed.
 *
 * This source file contains the logic to decide what to do with different
 * kinds of files, and the data structure to support it.  Before modifying
 * anything, pg_rewind collects information about all the files and their
 * attributes in the target and source data directories.  It also scans the
 * WAL log in the target, and collects information about data blocks that
 * were changed.  All this information is stored in a hash table, using the
 * file path relative to the root of the data directory as the key.
 *
 * After collecting all the information required, the decide_file_actions()
 * function scans the hash table and decides what action needs to be taken
 * for each file.  Finally, it sorts the array to the final order that the
 * actions should be executed in.
