# This tests loadbalancing based on a DNS entry that contains multiple records
# for different IPs. Since setting up a DNS server is more effort than we
# consider reasonable to run this test, this situation is instead imitated by
# using a hosts file where a single hostname maps to multiple different IP
# addresses. This test requires the administrator to add the following lines to
# the hosts file (if we detect that this hasn't happened we skip the test):
#
# 127.0.0.1 pg-loadbalancetest
# 127.0.0.2 pg-loadbalancetest
# 127.0.0.3 pg-loadbalancetest
#
# Windows or Linux are required to run this test because these OSes allow
# binding to 127.0.0.2 and 127.0.0.3 addresses by default, but other OSes
# don't. We need to bind to different IP addresses, so that we can use these
# different IP addresses in the hosts file.
#
# The hosts file needs to be prepared before running this test. We don't do it
# on the fly, because it requires root permissions to change the hosts file. In
# CI we set up the previously mentioned rules in the hosts file, so that this
# load balancing method is tested.
