Tests for data consistency between master and replica/standby.
=======================================

This directory contains a test suite for data consistency check
between master and replica/standby.

Running the tests
=================

NOTE: You must have given the --enable-tap-tests argument to configure.

Run
    make check
or
    make installcheck
You can use "make installcheck" if you previously did "make install".
In that case, the code in the installation tree is tested.  With
"make check", a temporary installation tree is built from the current
sources and then tested.

Either way, this test initializes, starts, and stops a test Postgres
cluster, including master node, replica node and standby node.

Requirements
============

Some PERL modules are required, such as IO::Pipe, Expect and Test::More.
