A litte helper module for testing MVCC performance.

The populate_mvcc_test_table function can be used to create a test table,
with given number of rows. Each row in the table is stamped with a different
xmin, and XMIN_COMMITTED hint bit can be set or not. Furthermore, the
xmins values are shuffled, to defeat caching in transam.c and clog.c as badly
as possible.

The test table is always called "mvcc_test_table". You'll have to drop it
yourself between tests.

For example:

-- Create a test table with 10 million rows, without setting hint bits
select populate_mvcc_test_table(10000000, false);

-- See how long it takes to scan it
\timing
select count(*) from mvcc_test_table;



If you do the above, but have another psql session open, in a transaction
that's done some updates, i.e. is holding backthe xmin horizon, you will
see the worst-case performance of the CSN patch.
