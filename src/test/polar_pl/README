Regression tests for recovery and replication for POLARDB
========================================================

This directory contains a test suite for recovery and replication.

Running the tests
=================

NOTE: You must have given the --enable-tap-tests and --enable-inject-faults 
argument to configure. Also, to use "make installcheck", you must have built
and installed contrib/test_decoding and contrib/faultinjector in addition 
to the core code.

Run
    make check
or
    make installcheck
You can use "make installcheck" if you previously did "make install".
In that case, the code in the installation tree is tested.  With
"make check", a temporary installation tree is built from the current
sources and then tested.

Either way, this test initializes, starts, and stops several test Postgres
clusters.
