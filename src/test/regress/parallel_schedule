# By convention, we put no more than twenty tests in any one parallel group;
# this limits the number of connections needed to run the tests.
# ----------

# run tablespace by itself, and first, because it forces a checkpoint;
# we'd prefer not to have checkpoints later in the tests because that
# interferes with crash-recovery testing.
test: tablespace

# ----------
# The first group of parallel tests
# ----------
test: boolean char name varchar text int2 int4 int8 oid float4 float8 bit numeric txid uuid enum money rangetypes pg_lsn regproc

# ----------
# The second group of parallel tests
# strings depends on char, varchar and text
# numerology depends on int2, int4, int8, float4, float8
# multirangetypes depends on rangetypes
# multirangetypes shouldn't run concurrently with type_sanity
# ----------
test: strings numerology point lseg line box path polygon circle date time timetz timestamp timestamptz interval inet macaddr macaddr8 multirangetypes create_function_0

# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests
# geometry depends on point, lseg, box, path, polygon and circle
# horology depends on interval, timetz, timestamp, timestamptz
# opr_sanity depends on create_function_0
# ----------
test: geometry horology tstypes regex type_sanity opr_sanity misc_sanity comments expressions unicode xid mvcc database

# ----------
# These four each depend on the previous one
# ----------
test: create_function_1
test: create_type
test: create_table
test: create_function_2

# ----------
# Load huge amounts of data
# We should split the data files into single files and then
# execute two copy tests parallel, to check that copy itself
# is concurrent safe.
# ----------
test: copy copyselect copydml insert insert_conflict

# ----------
# More groups of parallel tests
# ----------
test: create_misc create_operator create_procedure create_schema
# These depend on create_misc and create_operator
test: create_index create_index_spgist create_view index_including index_including_gist

# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests
# ----------
test: create_aggregate create_function_3 create_cast constraints triggers select inherit typed_table vacuum drop_if_exists updatable_views roleattributes create_am hash_func errors infinite_recurse

# ----------
# sanity_check does a vacuum, affecting the sort order of SELECT *
# results. So it should not run parallel to other tests.
# ----------
test: sanity_check

# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests
# Note: the ignore: line does not run random, just mark it as ignorable
# ----------
ignore: random
test: select_into select_distinct select_distinct_on select_implicit select_having subselect union case join aggregates transactions random portals arrays btree_index hash_index update delete namespace prepared_xacts

test: create_table_like alter_generic alter_operator misc async dbsize misc_functions sysviews tsrf tid tidscan tidrangescan collate.icu.utf8 incremental_sort

# rules cannot run concurrently with any test that creates
# a view or rule in the public schema
# collate.*.utf8 tests cannot be run in parallel with each other

# run by itself so it can run parallel workers
test: select_parallel
test: write_parallel
test: vacuum_parallel

# Run this alone, because concurrent DROP TABLE would make non-superuser
# "ANALYZE;" fail with "relation with OID $n does not exist".

# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests (JSON related)
# ----------
test: json jsonb json_encoding jsonpath jsonpath_encoding jsonb_jsonpath

# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests
# NB: temp.sql does a reconnect which transiently uses 2 connections,
# so keep this parallel group to at most 19 tests
# ----------
test: plancache limit plpgsql copy2 temp domain rangefuncs prepare conversion truncate alter_table sequence polymorphism rowtypes returning largeobject with xml

# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests
# ----------
test: partition_join partition_prune reloptions hash_part indexing partition_aggregate partition_info tuplesort explain compression memoize

# event triggers cannot run concurrently with any test that runs DDL
# oidjoins is read-only, though, and should run late for best coverage
test: event_trigger oidjoins
# this test also uses event triggers, so likewise run it by itself
test: fast_default

# run stats by itself because its delay may be insufficient under heavy load
test: stats
