# By convention, we put no more than twenty tests in any one parallel group;
# this limits the number of connections needed to run the tests.

# POLAR
# Some cases can not pass in POLARDB, ignore them.
# NOTICE: polar_ignore must add at the beginning of the schedule file
# ----------

# run tablespace by itself, and first, because it forces a checkpoint;
# we'd prefer not to have checkpoints later in the tests because that
# interferes with crash-recovery testing.

# The first group of parallel tests
# ----------
test: boolean char name varchar text int2 int4 int8 oid float4 float8 bit numeric txid uuid enum money rangetypes pg_lsn regproc

# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests
# geometry depends on point, lseg, box, path, polygon and circle
# horology depends on interval, timetz, timestamp, timestamptz, reltime and abstime
