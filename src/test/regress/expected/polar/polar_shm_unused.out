-- Whenever this test case failed it usually means there is a continus shared memory
-- area with more than 50MB size at the tail of the ShmemSegHdr segment that is requested
-- but not used, or wasted, in other words. Consider doing the following checks:
--      1. Check polar_get_shared_mem_total_size in ipci.c to make sure your feature has an enable
--      judgement in its add_size function.
--      2. Be careful using hash_estimate_size function when you request for a dynhash with a large
--      entrysize(MB level, practically) and small elementsize. The estimated size might exceed the
--      real demand a lot under such situation due to its internal implementation. Consider using
--      arrays instead.
--  If neither works please blame this file and contact the submitter for help, if he's still here.
