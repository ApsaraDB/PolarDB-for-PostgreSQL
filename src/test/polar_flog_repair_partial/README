Regression tests for PolarDB flashback log
========================================================

This directory contains a test suite for flashback log to repair partial write.

Running the tests
=================

NOTE: You must have given the --enable-tap-tests and argument to configure.
Also, to use "make installcheck", you must have built and installed
contrib/test_decoding in addition to the core code.

Run
    make check
or
    make installcheck
You can use "make installcheck" if you previously did "make install".
In that case, the code in the installation tree is tested.  With
"make check", a temporary installation tree is built from the current
sources and then tested.

Either way, this test initializes, starts, and stops several test Postgres
clusters.
