     * Since all open transactions are tracked in a single linked list on the
     * GTM, we need a mechanism to identify transactions associated with a
     * specific client connection so that they can be removed if the client
     * disconnects abrubptly. We could have something like a pthread_id given
     * that there is one GTM thread per connection, but that is not sufficient
     * when GTM is failed over to a standby. The pthread_id on the old master
     * will make no sense on the new master and it will be hard to re-establish
     * the association of open transactions and the client connections (note
     * that all of this applies only when backends are connecting to GTM via a
     * GTM proxy. Otherwise those open transactions will be aborted when GTM
     * failover happens)
     *
     * So we use a unique identifier for each incoming connection to the GTM.
     * GTM assigns the identifier and also sends it back to the client as part
     * of the connection establishment process. In case of GTM failover, and
     * when GTM proxies reconnect to the new master, they also send back the
     * identifier issued to them by the previous master. The new GTM master
     * then uses that identifier to associate open transactions with the client
     * connection. Of course, for this to work, GTM must store client
     * identifier in each transaction info structure and also replicate that
     * information to the standby when new transactions are backed up.
     *
     * Since GTM does not backup the action of assinging new identifiers, at
     * failover, it may happen that the new master hasn't yet seen an
     * identifier which is already assigned my the old master (say because the
     * client has not started any transaction yet). To handle this case, we
     * track the latest identifier as seen my the new master upon failover. If
     * a client sends an identifier which is newer than that, that identifier
     * is discarded and new master will issue a new identifier that client will
     * accept.
