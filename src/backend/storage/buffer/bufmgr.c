 * Backend-Private refcount management:

 * Each buffer also has a private refcount that keeps track of the number of

 * shared refcount needs to be modified only once if a buffer is pinned more
 * than once by an individual backend.  It's also used to check that no buffers
 * are still pinned at the end of transactions and when exiting.
 *
 *
 * To avoid - as we used to - requiring an array with NBuffers entries to keep
 * track of local buffers, we use a small sequentially searched array
 * (PrivateRefCountArray) and an overflow hash table (PrivateRefCountHash) to
 * keep track of backend local pins.
 *
 * Until no more than REFCOUNT_ARRAY_ENTRIES buffers are pinned at once, all
 * refcounts are kept track of in the array; after that, new array entries
 * displace old ones into the hash table. That way a frequently used entry
 * can't get "stuck" in the hashtable while infrequent ones clog the array.
 *
 * Note that in most scenarios the number of pinned buffers will not exceed
 * REFCOUNT_ARRAY_ENTRIES.
 *
 *
 * To enter a buffer into the refcount tracking mechanism first reserve a free
 * entry using ReservePrivateRefCountEntry() and then later, if necessary,
 * fill it with NewPrivateRefCountEntry(). That split lets us avoid doing
 * memory allocations in NewPrivateRefCountEntry() which can be important
