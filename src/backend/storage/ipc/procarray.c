 *
 * procarray.c
 *	  POSTGRES process array code.
 *
 *
 * This module maintains arrays of the PGPROC and PGXACT structures for all
 * active backends.  Although there are several uses for this, the principal
 * one is as a means of determining the set of currently running transactions.
 *
 * Because of various subtle race conditions it is critical that a backend
 * hold the correct locks while setting or clearing its MyPgXact->xid field.
 * See notes in src/backend/access/transam/README.
 *
 * The process arrays now also include structures representing prepared
 * transactions.  The xid fields of these are valid, as are the
 * myProcLocks lists.  They can be distinguished from regular backend PGPROCs
 * at need by checking for pid == 0.
 *
 * During hot standby, we update latestCompletedXid, oldestActiveXid, and
 * latestObservedXid, as we replay transaction commit/abort and standby WAL
 * records. Note that in hot standby, the PGPROC array represents standby
 * processes, which by definition are not running transactions that have XIDs.
 *
 *
 * We design a timestamp based MVCC garbage collection algorithm to
 * make the gc not to vacuum the tuple versions that are visible to
 * concurrent and pending transactions.
 *
 * The algorithm consists of two parts.
 * The first part is the admission of transaction execution. We reject
 * the transaction with global snapshot that may access the tuple versions
 * garbage collected.
 *
 * Specifically, we reject the snapshot with start ts < maxCommitTs - gc_interval
 * in order to resolve the conflict with vacuum and hot-chain cleanup.
 *
 * The parameter gc_interval represents the allowed maximum delay from
 * the snapshot generated on the coordinator to its arrival on data node.
 *
 * The second part is the determining of the oldest committs before which the tuple
 * versions can be pruned. See CommittsSatisfiesVacuum().
 * The oldest committs computation is implemented in GetRecentGlobalXmin() and GetOldestXmin().
 *
 * We also develop a global MVCC garbage collection which periodically collects
 * the minimal snapshot timestamp on each node to determine the globally minimal
 * timestamp.
 * Then we can use the globally minimal timestamp to vacuum stale tuple versions within
 * the cluster.

 * calculating the oldest xmin.
 *
 * This is used by VACUUM to decide which deleted tuples must be preserved in
 * the passed in table. For shared relations backends in all databases must be
 * considered, but for non-shared relations that's not required, since only
 * backends in my own database could ever see the tuples in them. Also, we can
 * ignore concurrently running lazy VACUUMs because (a) they must be working
 * on other tables, and (b) they don't need to do snapshot-based lookups.
 *
 * This is also used to determine where to truncate pg_csnlog. For that
 * backends in all databases have to be considered, so rel = NULL has to be
 * passed in.
 *
 * Note: we include all currently running xids in the set of considered xids.
 * This ensures that if a just-started xact has not yet set its snapshot,
 * when it does set the snapshot it cannot set xmin less than what we compute.
 * See notes in src/backend/access/transam/README.
 *
 * Note: despite the above, it's possible for the calculated value to move
 * backwards on repeated calls. The calculated value is conservative, so that
 * anything older is definitely not considered as running by anyone anymore,
 * but the exact value calculated depends on a number of things. For example,
 * if rel = NULL and there are no transactions running in the current
 * database, GetOldestXmin() returns latestCompletedXid. If a transaction
 * begins after that, its xmin will include in-progress transactions in other
 * databases that started earlier, so another call will return a lower value.
 * Nonetheless it is safe to vacuum a table in the current database with the
 * first result.  There are also replication-related effects: a walsender
 * process can set its xmin based on transactions that are no longer running
 * in the master but are still being replayed on the standby, thus possibly
 * making the GetOldestXmin reading go backwards.  In this case there is a
 * possibility that we lose data that the standby would like to have, but
 * unless the standby uses a replication slot to make its xmin persistent
 * there is little we can do about that --- data is only protected if the
 * walsender runs continuously while queries are executed on the standby.
 * (The Hot Standby code deals with such cases by failing standby queries
 * that needed to access already-removed data, so there's no integrity bug.)
 * The return value is also adjusted with vacuum_defer_cleanup_age, so
 * increasing that setting on the fly is another easy way to make
 * GetOldestXmin() move backwards, with no consequences for data integrity.
 *
 *
 * XXX: We track GlobalXmin in shared memory now. Would it makes sense to
 * have GetOldestXmin() just return that? At least for the rel == NULL case.
 *
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * We design a timestamp based MVCC garbage collection algorithm to
 * make the gc not to vacuum the tuple versions that are visible to
 * concurrent and pending transactions.
 *
 * The algorithm consists of two parts.
 * The first part is the admission of transaction execution. We reject
 * the transaction with global snapshot that may access the tuple versions
 * garbage collected.
 *
 * Specifically, we reject the snapshot with start ts < maxCommitTs - gc_interval
 * in order to resolve the conflict with vacuum and hot-chain cleanup.
 *
 * The parameter gc_interval represents the allowed maximum delay from
 * the snapshot generated on the coordinator to its arrival on data node.
 *
 * The second part is the determining of the oldest committs before which the tuple
 * versions can be pruned. See CommittsSatisfiesVacuum().
 * The oldest committs computation is implemented in GetRecentGlobalXmin() and GetOldestXmin().
