PolarDB Cluster Setting Implementation Notes
========================

The Polar Cluster Settings module implements configuration
file of both primary/replica/standby in cluster.
When init new cluster, initdb.c will copy parameters sample
to instance's polar_settings.conf depending on 'deploy-mode'

Config File Priority high to low:
1. postgresql.auto.conf
2. postgresql.conf
3. polar_settings.conf

Therefore, please note that the modification of the
postgresql.conf/postgresql.auto.conf will invalid the
config settings in polar_settings.conf.We purposely
designed this to support different configurations
for different nodes

polar_settings will take effect both in rw/ro/standby, Rely on
writing the WAL log to maintain consistency.

Kernel developments can use this to make config only takes
effect after initdb. But the upgrade old version to new version
does not take effect.To do this, you only need to add the new
parameter configuration in a specific deployment mode sample file.
