 *		for both index and heap relation entries in pg_class.
 *
 *		We violate transaction semantics here by overwriting the rel's

 *		safe as long as we're sure that the new values are correct whether or
 *		not this transaction commits.  The reason for doing this is that if
 *		we updated these tuples in the usual way, vacuuming pg_class itself
 *		wouldn't work very well --- by the time we got done with a vacuum
 *		cycle, most of the tuples in pg_class would've been obsoleted.  Of
 *		course, this only works for fixed-size not-null columns, but these are.
 *
 *		Another reason for doing it this way is that when we are in a lazy
 *		VACUUM and have PROC_IN_VACUUM set, we mustn't do any regular updates.
 *		Somebody vacuuming pg_class might think they could delete a tuple
 *		marked with xmin = our xid.
 *
 *		In addition to fundamentally nontransactional statistics such as
 *		relpages and relallvisible, we try to maintain certain lazily-updated
 *		DDL flags such as relhasindex, by clearing them if no longer correct.
 *		It's safe to do this in VACUUM, which can't run in parallel with
 *		CREATE INDEX/RULE/TRIGGER and can't be part of a transaction block.
 *		However, it's *not* safe to do it in an ANALYZE that's within an
 *		outer transaction, because for example the current transaction might
 *		have dropped the last index; then we'd think relhasindex should be
 *		cleared, but if the transaction later rolls back this would be wrong.
 *		So we refrain from updating the DDL flags if we're inside an outer
 *		transaction.  This is OK since postponing the flag maintenance is
 *		always allowable.
 *
 *		Note: num_tuples should count only *live* tuples, since
 *		pg_class.reltuples is defined that way.
