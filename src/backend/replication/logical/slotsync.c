 * slotsync.c
 *	   Functionality for synchronizing slots to a standby server from the

 *
 * Copyright (c) 2024, PostgreSQL Global Development Group
 *
 * IDENTIFICATION
 *	  src/backend/replication/logical/slotsync.c
 *
 * This file contains the code for slot synchronization on a physical standby
 * to fetch logical failover slots information from the primary server, create
 * the slots on the standby and synchronize them periodically.
 *
 * Slot synchronization can be performed either automatically by enabling slot
 * sync worker or manually by calling SQL function pg_sync_replication_slots().
 *
 * If the WAL corresponding to the remote's restart_lsn is not available on the
 * physical standby or the remote's catalog_xmin precedes the oldest xid for
 * which it is guaranteed that rows wouldn't have been removed then we cannot
 * create the local standby slot because that would mean moving the local slot
 * backward and decoding won't be possible via such a slot. In this case, the
 * slot will be marked as RS_TEMPORARY. Once the primary server catches up,
 * the slot will be marked as RS_PERSISTENT (which means sync-ready) after
 * which slot sync worker can perform the sync periodically or user can call
 * pg_sync_replication_slots() periodically to perform the syncs.
 *
 * If synchronized slots fail to build a consistent snapshot from the
 * restart_lsn before reaching confirmed_flush_lsn, they would become
 * unreliable after promotion due to potential data loss from changes
 * before reaching a consistent point. This can happen because the slots can
 * be synced at some random time and we may not reach the consistent point
 * at the same WAL location as the primary. So, we mark such slots as
 * RS_TEMPORARY. Once the decoding from corresponding LSNs can reach a
 * consistent point, they will be marked as RS_PERSISTENT.
 *
 * The slot sync worker waits for some time before the next synchronization,
 * with the duration varying based on whether any slots were updated during
 * the last cycle. Refer to the comments above wait_for_slot_activity() for
 * more details.
 *
 * Any standby synchronized slots will be dropped if they no longer need
 * to be synchronized. See comment atop drop_local_obsolete_slots() for more
 * details.

/*
 * Struct for sharing information to control slot synchronization.
 *
 * The slot sync worker's pid is needed by the startup process to shut it
 * down during promotion. The startup process shuts down the slot sync worker
 * and also sets stopSignaled=true to handle the race condition when the
 * postmaster has not noticed the promotion yet and thus may end up restarting
 * the slot sync worker. If stopSignaled is set, the worker will exit in such a
 * case. The SQL function pg_sync_replication_slots() will also error out if
 * this flag is set. Note that we don't need to reset this variable as after
 * promotion the slot sync worker won't be restarted because the pmState
 * changes to PM_RUN from PM_HOT_STANDBY and we don't support demoting
 * primary without restarting the server. See MaybeStartSlotSyncWorker.
 *
 * The 'syncing' flag is needed to prevent concurrent slot syncs to avoid slot
 * overwrites.
 *
 * The 'last_start_time' is needed by postmaster to start the slot sync worker
 * once per SLOTSYNC_RESTART_INTERVAL_SEC. In cases where an immediate restart
 * is expected (e.g., slot sync GUCs change), slot sync worker will reset
 * last_start_time before exiting, so that postmaster can start the worker
 * without waiting for SLOTSYNC_RESTART_INTERVAL_SEC.
