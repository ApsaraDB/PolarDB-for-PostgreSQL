 * Background process to perform WAL summarization, if it is enabled.
 * It continuously scans the write-ahead log and periodically emits a
 * summary file which indicates which blocks in which relation forks
 * were modified by WAL records in the LSN range covered by the summary
 * file. See walsummary.c and blkreftable.c for more details on the
 * naming and contents of WAL summary files.
 *
 * If configured to do, this background process will also remove WAL
 * summary files when the file timestamp is older than a configurable
 * threshold (but only if the WAL has been removed first).
