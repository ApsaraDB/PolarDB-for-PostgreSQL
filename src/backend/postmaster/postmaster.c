 *
 * postmaster.c
 *	  This program acts as a clearing house for requests to the
 *	  POSTGRES system.  Frontend programs connect to the Postmaster,
 *	  and postmaster forks a new backend process to handle the
 *	  connection.
 *
 *	  The postmaster also manages system-wide operations such as
 *	  startup and shutdown. The postmaster itself doesn't do those
 *	  operations, mind you --- it just forks off a subprocess to do them
 *	  at the right times.  It also takes care of resetting the system
 *	  if a backend crashes.
 *
 *	  The postmaster process creates the shared memory and semaphore
 *	  pools during startup, but as a rule does not touch them itself.
 *	  In particular, it is not a member of the PGPROC array of backends
 *	  and so it cannot participate in lock-manager operations.  Keeping
 *	  the postmaster away from shared memory operations makes it simpler
 *	  and more reliable.  The postmaster is almost always able to recover
 *	  from crashes of individual backends by resetting shared memory;
 *	  if it did much with shared memory then it would be prone to crashing
 *	  along with the backends.
 *
 *	  When a request message is received, we now fork() immediately.
 *	  The child process performs authentication of the request, and
 *	  then becomes a backend if successful.  This allows the auth code
 *	  to be written in a simple single-threaded style (as opposed to the
 *	  crufty "poor man's multitasking" code that used to be needed).
 *	  More importantly, it ensures that blockages in non-multithreaded
 *	  libraries like SSL or PAM cannot cause denial of service to other
 *	  clients.

 *
 * NOTES
 *
 * Initialization:
 *		The Postmaster sets up shared memory data structures
 *		for the backends.
 *
 * Synchronization:
 *		The Postmaster shares memory with the backends but should avoid
 *		touching shared memory, so as not to become stuck if a crashing
 *		backend screws up locks or shared memory.  Likewise, the Postmaster
 *		should never block on messages from frontend clients.
 *
 * Garbage Collection:
 *		The Postmaster cleans up after backends if they have an emergency
 *		exit and/or core dump.
 *
 * Error Reporting:
 *		Use write_stderr() only for reporting "interactive" errors
 *		(essentially, bogus arguments on the command line).  Once the
 *		postmaster is launched, use ereport().

 * We use a simple state machine to control startup, shutdown, and
 * crash recovery (which is rather like shutdown followed by startup).
 *
 * After doing all the postmaster initialization work, we enter PM_STARTUP
 * state and the startup process is launched. The startup process begins by
 * reading the control file and other preliminary initialization steps.
 * In a normal startup, or after crash recovery, the startup process exits
 * with exit code 0 and we switch to PM_RUN state.  However, archive recovery
 * is handled specially since it takes much longer and we would like to support
 * hot standby during archive recovery.
 *
 * When the startup process is ready to start archive recovery, it signals the
 * postmaster, and we switch to PM_RECOVERY state. The background writer and
 * checkpointer are launched, while the startup process continues applying WAL.
 * If Hot Standby is enabled, then, after reaching a consistent point in WAL
 * redo, startup process signals us again, and we switch to PM_HOT_STANDBY
 * state and begin accepting connections to perform read-only queries.  When
 * archive recovery is finished, the startup process exits with exit code 0
 * and we switch to PM_RUN state.
 *
 * Normal child backends can only be launched when we are in PM_RUN or
 * PM_HOT_STANDBY state.  (connsAllowed can also restrict launching.)
 * In other states we handle connection requests by launching "dead-end"
 * child processes, which will simply send the client an error message and
 * quit.  (We track these in the ActiveChildList so that we can know when they
 * are all gone; this is important because they're still connected to shared
 * memory, and would interfere with an attempt to destroy the shmem segment,
 * possibly leading to SHMALL failure when we try to make a new one.)
 * In PM_WAIT_DEAD_END state we are waiting for all the dead-end children
 * to drain out of the system, and therefore stop accepting connection
 * requests at all until the last existing child has quit (which hopefully
 * will not be very long).
 *
 * Notice that this state variable does not distinguish *why* we entered
 * states later than PM_RUN --- Shutdown and FatalError must be consulted
 * to find that out.  FatalError is never true in PM_RECOVERY, PM_HOT_STANDBY,
 * or PM_RUN states, nor in PM_WAIT_XLOG_SHUTDOWN states (because we don't
 * enter those states when trying to recover from a crash).  It can be true in
 * PM_STARTUP state, because we don't clear it until we've successfully
