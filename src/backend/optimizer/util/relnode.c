 * build_joinrel_tlist
 *	  Builds a join relation's target list from an input relation.

 *
 * The join's targetlist includes all Vars of its member relations that
 * will still be needed above the join.  This subroutine adds all such
 * Vars from the specified input rel's tlist to the join rel's tlist.
 * Likewise for any PlaceHolderVars emitted by the input rel.
 *
 * We also compute the expected width of the join's output, making use
 * of data that was cached at the baserel level by set_rel_width().
 *
 * Pass can_null as true if the join is an outer join that can null Vars
 * from this input relation.  If so, we will (normally) add the join's relid
 * to the nulling bitmaps of Vars and PHVs bubbled up from the input.
 *
 * When forming an outer join's target list, special handling is needed in
 * case the outer join was commuted with another one per outer join identity 3
 * (see optimizer/README).  We must take steps to ensure that the output Vars
 * have the same nulling bitmaps that they would if the two joins had been
 * done in syntactic order; else they won't match Vars appearing higher in
 * the query tree.  An exception to the match-the-syntactic-order rule is
 * that when an outer join is pushed down into another one's RHS per identity
 * 3, we can't mark its Vars as nulled until the now-upper outer join is also
 * completed.  So we need to do three things:
 *
 * First, we add the outer join's relid to the nulling bitmap only if the
 * outer join has been completely performed and the Var or PHV actually
 * comes from within the syntactically nullable side(s) of the outer join.
 * This takes care of the possibility that we have transformed
 *		(A leftjoin B on (Pab)) leftjoin C on (Pbc)
 * to
 *		A leftjoin (B leftjoin C on (Pbc)) on (Pab)
 * Here the pushed-down B/C join cannot mark C columns as nulled yet,
 * while the now-upper A/B join must not mark C columns as nulled by itself.
 *
 * Second, perform the same operation for each SpecialJoinInfo listed in
 * pushed_down_joins (which, in this example, would be the B/C join when
 * we are at the now-upper A/B join).  This allows the now-upper join to
 * complete the marking of "C" Vars that now have fully valid values.
 *
 * Third, any relid in sjinfo->commute_above_r that is already part of
 * the joinrel is added to the nulling bitmaps of nullable Vars and PHVs.
 * This takes care of the reverse case where we implement
 *		A leftjoin (B leftjoin C on (Pbc)) on (Pab)
 * as
 *		(A leftjoin B on (Pab)) leftjoin C on (Pbc)
 * The C columns emitted by the B/C join need to be shown as nulled by both
 * the B/C and A/B joins, even though they've not physically traversed the
 * A/B join.

 *	  candidate pair of sub-relations.  But the restriction list is whatever
 *	  is not handled in the sub-relations, so it depends on which
 *	  sub-relations are considered.
 *
 *	  If a join clause from an input relation refers to base+OJ rels still not
 *	  present in the joinrel, then it is still a join clause for the joinrel;
 *	  we put it into the joininfo list for the joinrel.  Otherwise,
 *	  the clause is now a restrict clause for the joined relation, and we
 *	  return it to the caller of build_joinrel_restrictlist() to be stored in
 *	  join paths made from this pair of sub-relations.  (It will not need to
 *	  be considered further up the join tree.)
 *
 *	  In many cases we will find the same RestrictInfos in both input
 *	  relations' joinlists, so be careful to eliminate duplicates.
 *	  Pointer equality should be a sufficient test for dups, since all
 *	  the various joinlist entries ultimately refer to RestrictInfos
 *	  pushed into them by distribute_restrictinfo_to_rels().
 *
 * 'joinrel' is a join relation node
 * 'outer_rel' and 'inner_rel' are a pair of relations that can be joined
 *		to form joinrel.
 * 'sjinfo': join context info
 *
 * build_joinrel_restrictlist() returns a list of relevant restrictinfos,
 * whereas build_joinrel_joinlist() stores its results in the joinrel's
 * joininfo list.  One or the other must accept each given clause!
 *
 * NB: Formerly, we made deep(!) copies of each input RestrictInfo to pass
 * up to the join relation.  I believe this is no longer necessary, because
 * RestrictInfo nodes are no longer context-dependent.  Instead, just include
 * the original nodes in the lists made for the join relation.
