 * after initsplan.c has done its work, and can do additional join removal

 * the query, since the derived data structures have to be updated too.

 * Search for joins where a relation is joined to itself. If the join clause

 * physical row (or nothing) on the other side, that self-join can be
 * eliminated from the query.  Suitable join clauses are assumed to be in the
 * form of X = X, and can be replaced with NOT NULL clauses.
 *
 * For the sake of simplicity, we don't apply this optimization to special
 * joins. Here is a list of what we could do in some particular cases:
 * 'a a1 semi join a a2': is reduced to inner by reduce_unique_semijoins,
 * and then removed normally.
 * 'a a1 anti join a a2': could simplify to a scan with 'outer quals AND
 * (IS NULL on join columns OR NOT inner quals)'.
 * 'a a1 left join a a2': could simplify to a scan like inner but without
 * NOT NULL conditions on join columns.
 * 'a a1 left join (a a2 join b)': can't simplify this, because join to b
 * can both remove rows and introduce duplicates.
 *
 * To search for removable joins, we order all the relations on their Oid,
 * go over each set with the same Oid, and consider each pair of relations
 * in this set.
 *
 * To remove the join, we mark one of the participating relations as dead
 * and rewrite all references to it to point to the remaining relation.
 * This includes modifying RestrictInfos, EquivalenceClasses, and
 * EquivalenceMembers. We also have to modify the row marks. The join clauses
 * of the removed relation become either restriction or join clauses, based on
 * whether they reference any relations not participating in the removed join.
 *
 * 'joinlist' is the top-level joinlist of the query. If it has any
 * references to the removed relations, we update them to point to the
 * remaining ones.
