/*
 * pull_up_sublinks
 *		Attempt to pull up ANY and EXISTS SubLinks to be treated as
 *		semijoins or anti-semijoins.
 *
 * A clause "foo op ANY (sub-SELECT)" can be processed by pulling the
 * sub-SELECT up to become a rangetable entry and treating the implied
 * comparisons as quals of a semijoin.  However, this optimization *only*
 * works at the top level of WHERE or a JOIN/ON clause, because we cannot
 * distinguish whether the ANY ought to return FALSE or NULL in cases
 * involving NULL inputs.  Also, in an outer join's ON clause we can only
 * do this if the sublink is degenerate (ie, references only the nullable
 * side of the join).  In that case it is legal to push the semijoin
 * down into the nullable side of the join.  If the sublink references any
 * nonnullable-side variables then it would have to be evaluated as part
 * of the outer join, which makes things way too complicated.
 *
 * Under similar conditions, EXISTS and NOT EXISTS clauses can be handled
 * by pulling up the sub-SELECT and creating a semijoin or anti-semijoin.
 *
 * This routine searches for such clauses and does the necessary parsetree
 * transformations if any are found.
 *
 * This routine has to run before preprocess_expression(), so the quals
 * clauses are not yet reduced to implicit-AND format, and are not guaranteed
 * to be AND/OR-flat either.  That means we need to recursively search through
 * explicit AND clauses.  We stop as soon as we hit a non-AND item.

 * pull_up_subqueries_recurse
 *		Recursive guts of pull_up_subqueries.
 *
 * This recursively processes the jointree and returns a modified jointree.
 * Or, if it's valid to drop the current node from the jointree completely,
 * it returns NULL.
 *
 * If this jointree node is within either side of an outer join, then
 * lowest_outer_join references the lowest such JoinExpr node; otherwise
 * it is NULL.  We use this to constrain the effects of LATERAL subqueries.
 *
 * If this jointree node is within the nullable side of an outer join, then
 * lowest_nulling_outer_join references the lowest such JoinExpr node;
 * otherwise it is NULL.  This forces use of the PlaceHolderVar mechanism for
 * references to non-nullable targetlist items, but only for references above
 * that join.
 *
 * If we are looking at a member subquery of an append relation,
 * containing_appendrel describes that relation; else it is NULL.
 * This forces use of the PlaceHolderVar mechanism for all non-Var targetlist
 * items, and puts some additional restrictions on what can be pulled up.
 *
 * deletion_ok is true if the caller can cope with us returning NULL for a
 * deletable leaf node (for example, a VALUES RTE that could be pulled up).
 * If it's false, we'll avoid pullup in such cases.
 *
 * A tricky aspect of this code is that if we pull up a subquery we have
 * to replace Vars that reference the subquery's outputs throughout the
 * parent query, including quals attached to jointree nodes above the one
 * we are currently processing!  We handle this by being careful not to
 * change the jointree structure while recursing: no nodes other than leaf
 * RangeTblRef entries and entirely-empty FromExprs will be replaced or
 * deleted.  Also, we can't turn pullup_replace_vars loose on the whole
 * jointree, because it'll return a mutated copy of the tree; we have to
 * invoke it just on the quals, instead.  This behavior is what makes it
 * reasonable to pass lowest_outer_join and lowest_nulling_outer_join as
 * pointers rather than some more-indirect way of identifying the lowest
 * OJs.  Likewise, we don't replace append_rel_list members but only their
 * substructure, so the containing_appendrel reference is safe to use.
 *
 * Because of the rule that no jointree nodes with substructure can be
 * replaced, we cannot fully handle the case of deleting nodes from the tree:
 * when we delete one child of a JoinExpr, we need to replace the JoinExpr
 * with a FromExpr, and that can't happen here.  Instead, we set the
 * root->hasDeletedRTEs flag, which tells pull_up_subqueries() that an
 * additional pass over the tree is needed to clean up.

/*
 * reduce_outer_joins
 *		Attempt to reduce outer joins to plain inner joins.
 *
 * The idea here is that given a query like
 *		SELECT ... FROM a LEFT JOIN b ON (...) WHERE b.y = 42;
 * we can reduce the LEFT JOIN to a plain JOIN if the "=" operator in WHERE
 * is strict.  The strict operator will always return NULL, causing the outer
 * WHERE to fail, on any row where the LEFT JOIN filled in NULLs for b's
 * columns.  Therefore, there's no need for the join to produce null-extended
 * rows in the first place --- which makes it a plain join not an outer join.
 * (This scenario may not be very likely in a query written out by hand, but
 * it's reasonably likely when pushing quals down into complex views.)
 *
 * More generally, an outer join can be reduced in strength if there is a
 * strict qual above it in the qual tree that constrains a Var from the
 * nullable side of the join to be non-null.  (For FULL joins this applies
 * to each side separately.)
 *
 * Another transformation we apply here is to recognize cases like
 *		SELECT ... FROM a LEFT JOIN b ON (a.x = b.y) WHERE b.y IS NULL;
 * If the join clause is strict for b.y, then only null-extended rows could
 * pass the upper WHERE, and we can conclude that what the query is really
 * specifying is an anti-semijoin.  We change the join type from JOIN_LEFT
 * to JOIN_ANTI.  The IS NULL clause then becomes redundant, and must be
 * removed to prevent bogus selectivity calculations, but we leave it to
 * distribute_qual_to_rels to get rid of such clauses.
 *
 * Also, we get rid of JOIN_RIGHT cases by flipping them around to become
 * JOIN_LEFT.  This saves some code here and in some later planner routines,
 * but the main reason to do it is to not need to invent a JOIN_REVERSE_ANTI
 * join type.
 *
 * To ease recognition of strict qual clauses, we require this routine to be
 * run after expression preprocessing (i.e., qual canonicalization and JOIN
 * alias-var expansion).
