 *	  from a time when only UNIONs were implemented.
 *
 * There are two code paths in the planner for set-operation queries.
 * If a subquery consists entirely of simple UNION ALL operations, it
 * is converted into an "append relation".  Otherwise, it is handled
 * by the general code in this module (plan_set_operations and its
 * subroutines).  There is some support code here for the append-relation
 * case, but most of the heavy lifting for that is done elsewhere,
 * notably in prepjointree.c and allpaths.c.
