 * table has a relatively small number of entries (much less than 2^32)
 * and there aren't very long runs of consecutive existing OIDs.  Again,
 * this is reasonable for system catalogs but less so for user tables.
 *
 * Since the OID is not immediately inserted into the table, there is a
 * race condition here; but a problem could occur only if someone else
 * managed to cycle through 2^32 OIDs and generate the same OID before we
 * finish inserting our row.  This seems unlikely to be a problem.  Note
 * that if we had to *commit* the row to end the race condition, the risk
 * would be rather higher; therefore we use SnapshotAny in the test, so that
 * we will see uncommitted rows.  (We used to use SnapshotDirty, but that has
 * the disadvantage that it ignores recently-deleted rows, creating a risk
 * of transient conflicts for as long as our own MVCC snapshots think a
 * recently-deleted row is live.  The risk is far higher when selecting TOAST
 * OIDs, because SnapshotToast considers dead rows as active indefinitely.)
