 * nbtsort.c
 *		Build a btree from sorted input by loading leaf pages sequentially.
 *
 * NOTES
 *
 * We use tuplesort.c to sort the given index tuples into order.
 * Then we scan the index tuples in order and build the btree pages
 * for each level.  We load source tuples into leaf-level pages.
 * Whenever we fill a page at one level, we add a link to it to its
 * parent level (starting a new parent level if necessary).  When
 * done, we write out each final page on each level, adding it to
 * its parent level.  When we have only one page on a level, it must be
 * the root -- it can be attached to the btree metapage and we are done.
 *
 * It is not wise to pack the pages entirely full, since then *any*
 * insertion would cause a split (and not only of the leaf page; the need
 * for a split would cascade right up the tree).  The steady-state load
 * factor for btrees is usually estimated at 70%.  We choose to pack leaf
 * pages to the user-controllable fill factor (default 90%) while upper pages
 * are always packed to 70%.  This gives us reasonable density (there aren't
 * many upper pages if the keys are reasonable-size) without risking a lot of
 * cascading splits during early insertions.
 *
 * Formerly the index pages being built were kept in shared buffers, but
 * that is of no value (since other backends have no interest in them yet)
 * and it created locking problems for CHECKPOINT, because the upper-level
 * pages were held exclusive-locked for long periods.  Now we just build
 * the pages in local memory and smgrwrite or smgrextend them as we finish
 * them.  They will need to be re-read into shared buffers on first use after
 * the build finishes.
 *
 * Since the index will never be used unless it is completely built,
 * from a crash-recovery point of view there is no need to WAL-log the
 * steps of the build.  After completing the index build, we can just sync
 * the whole file to disk using smgrimmedsync() before exiting this module.
 * This can be seen to be sufficient for crash recovery by considering that
 * it's effectively equivalent to what would happen if a CHECKPOINT occurred
 * just after the index build.  However, it is clearly not sufficient if the
 * DBA is using the WAL log for PITR or replication purposes, since another
 * machine would not be able to reconstruct the index from WAL.  Therefore,
 * we log the completed index pages to WAL if and only if WAL archiving is
 * active.
 *
 * This code isn't concerned about the FSM at all. The caller is responsible
 * for initializing that.

 *	 stored, we should store only the link.
 *
 * A leaf page being built looks like:
 *
 * +----------------+---------------------------------+
 * | PageHeaderData | linp0 linp1 linp2 ...           |
 * +-----------+----+---------------------------------+
 * | ... linpN |									  |

 * +-------------+------------------+-----------------+
 * |		  ... item3 item2 item1 | "special space" |
 * +--------------------------------+-----------------+
 *
 * Contrast this with the diagram in bufpage.h; note the mismatch
 * between linps and items.  This is because we reserve linp0 as a
 * placeholder for the pointer to the "high key" item; when we have
 * filled up the page, we will set linp0 to point to itemN and clear
 * linpN.  On the other hand, if we find this is the last (rightmost)
 * page, we leave the items alone and slide the linp array over.  If
 * the high key is to be truncated, offset 1 is deleted, and we insert
 * the truncated high key at offset 1.
