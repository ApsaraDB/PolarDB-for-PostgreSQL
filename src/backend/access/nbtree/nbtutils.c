 *	_bt_preprocess_array_keys() -- Preprocess SK_SEARCHARRAY scan keys
 *
 * If there are any SK_SEARCHARRAY scan keys, deconstruct the array(s) and
 * set up BTArrayKeyInfo info for each one that is an equality-type key.
 * Returns modified scan keys as input for further, standard preprocessing.
 *
 * Currently we perform two kinds of preprocessing to deal with redundancies.
 * For inequality array keys, it's sufficient to find the extreme element
 * value and replace the whole array with that scalar value.  This eliminates
 * all but one array element as redundant.  Similarly, we are capable of
 * "merging together" multiple equality array keys (from two or more input
 * scan keys) into a single output scan key containing only the intersecting
 * array elements.  This can eliminate many redundant array elements, as well
 * as eliminating whole array scan keys as redundant.  It can also allow us to
 * detect contradictory quals.
 *
 * It is convenient for _bt_preprocess_keys caller to have to deal with no
 * more than one equality strategy array scan key per index attribute.  We'll
 * always be able to set things up that way when complete opfamilies are used.
 * Eliminated array scan keys can be recognized as those that have had their
 * sk_strategy field set to InvalidStrategy here by us.  Caller should avoid
 * including these in the scan's so->keyData[] output array.
 *
 * We set the scan key references from the scan's BTArrayKeyInfo info array to
 * offsets into the temp modified input array returned to caller.  Scans that
 * have array keys should call _bt_preprocess_array_keys_final when standard
 * preprocessing steps are complete.  This will convert the scan key offset
 * references into references to the scan's so->keyData[] output scan keys.
 *
 * Note: the reason we need to return a temp scan key array, rather than just
 * scribbling on scan->keyData, is that callers are permitted to call btrescan
 * without supplying a new set of scankey data.

 * Called when _bt_advance_array_keys decides to start a new primitive index
 * scan on the basis of the current scan position being before the position
 * that _bt_first is capable of repositioning the scan to by applying an
 * inequality operator required in the opposite-to-scan direction only.
 *
 * Although equality strategy scan keys (for both arrays and non-arrays alike)
 * are either marked required in both directions or in neither direction,
 * there is a sense in which non-required arrays behave like required arrays.
 * With a qual such as "WHERE a IN (100, 200) AND b >= 3 AND c IN (5, 6, 7)",
 * the scan key on "c" is non-required, but nevertheless enables positioning
 * the scan at the first tuple >= "(100, 3, 5)" on the leaf level during the
 * first descent of the tree by _bt_first.  Later on, there could also be a
 * second descent, that places the scan right before tuples >= "(200, 3, 5)".
 * _bt_first must never be allowed to build an insertion scan key whose "c"
 * entry is set to a value other than 5, the "c" array's first element/value.
 * (Actually, it's the first in the current scan direction.  This example uses
 * a forward scan.)
 *
 * Calling here resets the array scan key elements for the scan's non-required
 * arrays.  This is strictly necessary for correctness in a subset of cases
 * involving "required in opposite direction"-triggered primitive index scans.
 * Not all callers are at risk of _bt_first using a non-required array like
 * this, but advancement always resets the arrays when another primitive scan
 * is scheduled, just to keep things simple.  Array advancement even makes
 * sure to reset non-required arrays during scans that have no inequalities.
 * (Advancement still won't call here when there are no inequalities, though
 * that's just because it's all handled indirectly instead.)
 *
 * Note: _bt_verify_arrays_bt_first is called by an assertion to enforce that
 * everybody got this right.

 * _bt_tuple_before_array_skeys() -- too early to advance required arrays?

 * scan's current _bt_readpage-wise tuple.
 *
 * readpagetup callers must only call here when _bt_check_compare already set
 * continuescan=false.  We help these callers deal with _bt_check_compare's
 * inability to distinguishing between the < and > cases (it uses equality
 * operator scan keys, whereas we use 3-way ORDER procs).  These callers pass
 * a _bt_check_compare-set sktrig value that indicates which scan key
 * triggered the call (!readpagetup callers just pass us sktrig=0 instead).
 * This information allows us to avoid wastefully checking earlier scan keys
 * that were already deemed to have been satisfied inside _bt_check_compare.
 *
 * Returns false when caller's tuple is >= the current required equality scan
 * keys (or <=, in the case of backwards scans).  This happens to readpagetup
 * callers when the scan has reached the point of needing its array keys
 * advanced; caller will need to advance required and non-required arrays at
 * scan key offsets >= sktrig, plus scan keys < sktrig iff sktrig rolls over.
 * (When we return false to readpagetup callers, tuple can only be == current
 * required equality scan keys when caller's sktrig indicates that the arrays
 * need to be advanced due to an unsatisfied required inequality key trigger.)
 *
 * Returns true when caller passes a tuple that is < the current set of
 * equality keys for the most significant non-equal required scan key/column
 * (or > the keys, during backwards scans).  This happens to readpagetup
 * callers when tuple is still before the start of matches for the scan's
 * required equality strategy scan keys.  (sktrig can't have indicated that an
 * inequality strategy scan key wasn't satisfied in _bt_check_compare when we
 * return true.  In fact, we automatically return false when passed such an
 * inequality sktrig by readpagetup callers -- _bt_check_compare's initial
 * continuescan=false doesn't really need to be confirmed here by us.)
 *
 * !readpagetup callers optionally pass us *scanBehind, which tracks whether
 * any missing truncated attributes might have affected array advancement
 * (compared to what would happen if it was shown the first non-pivot tuple on
 * the page to the right of caller's finaltup/high key tuple instead).  It's
 * only possible that we'll set *scanBehind to true when caller passes us a
 * pivot tuple (with truncated -inf attributes) that we return false for.

 * used here (at least until the next call here advances the keys once again).
 * It's convenient to structure _bt_check_compare rechecks of caller's tuple
 * (using the new qual) as one the steps of advancing the scan's array keys,
 * so this function works as a wrapper around _bt_check_compare.
 *
 * Like _bt_check_compare, we'll set pstate.continuescan on behalf of the
 * caller, and return a boolean indicating if caller's tuple satisfies the
 * scan's new qual.  But unlike _bt_check_compare, we set so->needPrimScan
 * when we set continuescan=false, indicating if a new primitive index scan
 * has been scheduled (otherwise, the top-level scan has run out of tuples in
 * the current scan direction).
 *
 * Caller must use _bt_tuple_before_array_skeys to determine if the current
 * place in the scan is >= the current array keys _before_ calling here.
 * We're responsible for ensuring that caller's tuple is <= the newly advanced
 * required array keys once we return.  We try to find an exact match, but
 * failing that we'll advance the array keys to whatever set of array elements
 * comes next in the key space for the current scan direction.  Required array
 * keys "ratchet forwards" (or backwards).  They can only advance as the scan
 * itself advances through the index/key space.
 *
 * (The rules are the same for backwards scans, except that the operators are
 * flipped: just replace the precondition's >= operator with a <=, and the
 * postcondition's <= operator with a >=.  In other words, just swap the
 * precondition with the postcondition.)
 *
 * We also deal with "advancing" non-required arrays here.  Callers whose
 * sktrig scan key is non-required specify sktrig_required=false.  These calls
 * are the only exception to the general rule about always advancing the
 * required array keys (the scan may not even have a required array).  These
 * callers should just pass a NULL pstate (since there is never any question
 * of stopping the scan).  No call to _bt_tuple_before_array_skeys is required
 * ahead of these calls (it's already clear that any required scan keys must
 * be satisfied by caller's tuple).
 *
 * Note that we deal with non-array required equality strategy scan keys as
 * degenerate single element arrays here.  Obviously, they can never really
 * advance in the way that real arrays can, but they must still affect how we
 * advance real array scan keys (exactly like true array equality scan keys).
 * We have to keep around a 3-way ORDER proc for these (using the "=" operator
 * won't do), since in general whether the tuple is < or > _any_ unsatisfied
 * required equality key influences how the scan's real arrays must advance.
 *
 * Note also that we may sometimes need to advance the array keys when the
 * existing required array keys (and other required equality keys) are already
 * an exact match for every corresponding value from caller's tuple.  We must
 * do this for inequalities that _bt_check_compare set continuescan=false for.
 * They'll advance the array keys here, just like any other scan key that
 * _bt_check_compare stops on.  (This can even happen _after_ we advance the
 * array keys, in which case we'll advance the array keys a second time.  That
 * way _bt_checkkeys caller always has its required arrays advance to the
 * maximum possible extent that its tuple will allow.)

 *	_bt_preprocess_keys() -- Preprocess scan keys
 *
 * The given search-type keys (taken from scan->keyData[])
 * are copied to so->keyData[] with possible transformation.
 * scan->numberOfKeys is the number of input keys, so->numberOfKeys gets
 * the number of output keys (possibly less, never greater).
 *
 * The output keys are marked with additional sk_flags bits beyond the
 * system-standard bits supplied by the caller.  The DESC and NULLS_FIRST
 * indoption bits for the relevant index attribute are copied into the flags.
 * Also, for a DESC column, we commute (flip) all the sk_strategy numbers
 * so that the index sorts in the desired direction.
 *
 * One key purpose of this routine is to discover which scan keys must be
 * satisfied to continue the scan.  It also attempts to eliminate redundant
 * keys and detect contradictory keys.  (If the index opfamily provides
 * incomplete sets of cross-type operators, we may fail to detect redundant
 * or contradictory keys, but we can survive that.)
 *
 * The output keys must be sorted by index attribute.  Presently we expect
 * (but verify) that the input keys are already so sorted --- this is done
 * by match_clauses_to_index() in indxpath.c.  Some reordering of the keys
 * within each attribute may be done as a byproduct of the processing here.
 * That process must leave array scan keys (within an attribute) in the same
 * order as corresponding entries from the scan's BTArrayKeyInfo array info.
 *
 * The output keys are marked with flags SK_BT_REQFWD and/or SK_BT_REQBKWD
 * if they must be satisfied in order to continue the scan forward or backward
 * respectively.  _bt_checkkeys uses these flags.  For example, if the quals
 * are "x = 1 AND y < 4 AND z < 5", then _bt_checkkeys will reject a tuple
 * (1,2,7), but we must continue the scan in case there are tuples (1,3,z).
 * But once we reach tuples like (1,4,z) we can stop scanning because no
 * later tuples could match.  This is reflected by marking the x and y keys,
 * but not the z key, with SK_BT_REQFWD.  In general, the keys for leading
 * attributes with "=" keys are marked both SK_BT_REQFWD and SK_BT_REQBKWD.
 * For the first attribute without an "=" key, any "<" and "<=" keys are
 * marked SK_BT_REQFWD while any ">" and ">=" keys are marked SK_BT_REQBKWD.
 * This can be seen to be correct by considering the above example.  Note
 * in particular that if there are no keys for a given attribute, the keys for
 * subsequent attributes can never be required; for instance "WHERE y = 4"
 * requires a full-index scan.
 *
 * If possible, redundant keys are eliminated: we keep only the tightest
 * >/>= bound and the tightest </<= bound, and if there's an = key then
 * that's the only one returned.  (So, we return either a single = key,
 * or one or two boundary-condition keys for each attr.)  However, if we
 * cannot compare two keys for lack of a suitable cross-type operator,
 * we cannot eliminate either.  If there are two such keys of the same
 * operator strategy, the second one is just pushed into the output array
 * without further processing here.  We may also emit both >/>= or both
 * </<= keys if we can't compare them.  The logic about required keys still
 * works if we don't eliminate redundant keys.
 *
 * Note that one reason we need direction-sensitive required-key flags is
 * precisely that we may not be able to eliminate redundant keys.  Suppose
 * we have "x > 4::int AND x > 10::bigint", and we are unable to determine
 * which key is more restrictive for lack of a suitable cross-type operator.
 * _bt_first will arbitrarily pick one of the keys to do the initial
 * positioning with.  If it picks x > 4, then the x > 10 condition will fail
 * until we reach index entries > 10; but we can't stop the scan just because
 * x > 10 is failing.  On the other hand, if we are scanning backwards, then
 * failure of either key is indeed enough to stop the scan.  (In general, when
 * inequality keys are present, the initial-positioning code only promises to
 * position before the first possible match, not exactly at the first match,
 * for a forward scan; or after the last match for a backward scan.)
 *
 * As a byproduct of this work, we can detect contradictory quals such
 * as "x = 1 AND x > 2".  If we see that, we return so->qual_ok = false,
 * indicating the scan need not be run at all since no tuples can match.
 * (In this case we do not bother completing the output key array!)
 * Again, missing cross-type operators might cause us to fail to prove the
 * quals contradictory when they really are, but the scan will work correctly.
 *
 * Row comparison keys are currently also treated without any smarts:
 * we just transfer them into the preprocessed array without any
 * editorialization.  We can treat them the same as an ordinary inequality
 * comparison on the row's first index column, for the purposes of the logic
 * about required keys.
 *
 * Note: the reason we have to copy the preprocessed scan keys into private
 * storage is that we are modifying the array based on comparisons of the
 * key argument values, which could change on a rescan.  Therefore we can't
 * overwrite the source data.
