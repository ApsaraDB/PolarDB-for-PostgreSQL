 * _bt_mkscankey
 *		Build an insertion scan key that contains comparison data from itup
 *		as well as comparator routines appropriate to the key datatypes.
 *
 *		The result is intended for use with _bt_compare() and _bt_truncate().
 *		Callers that don't need to fill out the insertion scankey arguments
 *		(e.g. they use an ad-hoc comparison routine, or only need a scankey
 *		for _bt_truncate()) can pass a NULL index tuple.  The scankey will
 *		be initialized as if an "all truncated" pivot tuple was passed
 *		instead.
 *
 *		Note that we may occasionally have to share lock the metapage to
 *		determine whether or not the keys in the index are expected to be
 *		unique (i.e. if this is a "heapkeyspace" index).  We assume a
 *		heapkeyspace index when caller passes a NULL tuple, allowing index
 *		build callers to avoid accessing the non-existent metapage.  We
 *		also assume that the index is _not_ allequalimage when a NULL tuple
 *		is passed; CREATE INDEX callers call _bt_allequalimage() to set the
 *		field themselves.

 * It's convenient to structure _bt_check_compare rechecks of caller's tuple
 * (using the new qual) as one the steps of advancing the scan's array keys,
 * so this function works as a wrapper around _bt_check_compare.
 *
 * Like _bt_check_compare, we'll set pstate.continuescan on behalf of the
 * caller, and return a boolean indicating if caller's tuple satisfies the
 * scan's new qual.  But unlike _bt_check_compare, we set so->needPrimScan
 * when we set continuescan=false, indicating if a new primitive index scan
 * has been scheduled (otherwise, the top-level scan has run out of tuples in
 * the current scan direction).
 *
 * Caller must use _bt_tuple_before_array_skeys to determine if the current
 * place in the scan is >= the current array keys _before_ calling here.
 * We're responsible for ensuring that caller's tuple is <= the newly advanced
 * required array keys once we return.  We try to find an exact match, but
 * failing that we'll advance the array keys to whatever set of array elements
 * comes next in the key space for the current scan direction.  Required array
 * keys "ratchet forwards" (or backwards).  They can only advance as the scan
 * itself advances through the index/key space.
 *
 * (The rules are the same for backwards scans, except that the operators are
 * flipped: just replace the precondition's >= operator with a <=, and the
 * postcondition's <= operator with a >=.  In other words, just swap the
 * precondition with the postcondition.)
 *
 * We also deal with "advancing" non-required arrays here (or arrays that are
 * treated as non-required for the duration of a _bt_readpage call).  Callers
 * whose sktrig scan key is non-required specify sktrig_required=false.  These
 * calls are the only exception to the general rule about always advancing the
 * required array keys (the scan may not even have a required array).  These
 * callers should just pass a NULL pstate (since there is never any question
 * of stopping the scan).  No call to _bt_tuple_before_array_skeys is required
 * ahead of these calls (it's already clear that any required scan keys must
 * be satisfied by caller's tuple).
 *
 * Note that we deal with non-array required equality strategy scan keys as
 * degenerate single element arrays here.  Obviously, they can never really
 * advance in the way that real arrays can, but they must still affect how we
 * advance real array scan keys (exactly like true array equality scan keys).
 * We have to keep around a 3-way ORDER proc for these (using the "=" operator
 * won't do), since in general whether the tuple is < or > _any_ unsatisfied
 * required equality key influences how the scan's real arrays must advance.
 *
 * Note also that we may sometimes need to advance the array keys when the
 * existing required array keys (and other required equality keys) are already
 * an exact match for every corresponding value from caller's tuple.  We must
 * do this for inequalities that _bt_check_compare set continuescan=false for.
 * They'll advance the array keys here, just like any other scan key that
 * _bt_check_compare stops on.  (This can even happen _after_ we advance the
 * array keys, in which case we'll advance the array keys a second time.  That
 * way _bt_checkkeys caller always has its required arrays advance to the
