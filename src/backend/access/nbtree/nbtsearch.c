	 * storing their addresses into the local startKeys[] array.  The final
	 * startKeys[] entry's strategy is set in strat_total. (Actually, there
	 * are a couple of cases where we force a less/more restrictive strategy.)
	 *
	 * We must use the key that was marked required (in the direction opposite
	 * our own scan's) during preprocessing.  Each index attribute can only
	 * have one such required key.  In general, the keys that we use to find
	 * an initial position when scanning forwards are the same keys that end
	 * the scan on the leaf level when scanning backwards (and vice-versa).
	 *
	 * When the scan keys include cross-type operators, _bt_preprocess_keys
	 * may not be able to eliminate redundant keys; in such cases it will
	 * arbitrarily pick a usable key for each attribute (and scan direction),
	 * ensuring that there is no more than one key required in each direction.
	 * We stop considering further keys once we reach the first nonrequired
	 * key (which must come after all required keys), so this can't affect us.
	 *
	 * The required keys that we use as starting boundaries have to be =, >,
	 * or >= keys for a forward scan or =, <, <= keys for a backwards scan.
	 * We can use keys for multiple attributes so long as the prior attributes
	 * had only =, >= (resp. =, <=) keys.  These rules are very similar to the
	 * rules that preprocessing used to determine which keys to mark required.
	 * We cannot always use every required key as a positioning key, though.
	 * Skip arrays necessitate independently applying our own rules here.
	 * Skip arrays are always generally considered = array keys, but we'll
	 * nevertheless treat them as inequalities at certain points of the scan.
	 * When that happens, it _might_ have implications for the number of
	 * required keys that we can safely use for initial positioning purposes.
	 *
	 * For example, a forward scan with a skip array on its leading attribute
	 * (with no low_compare/high_compare) will have at least two required scan
	 * keys, but we won't use any of them as boundary keys during the scan's
	 * initial call here.  Our positioning key during the first call here can
	 * be thought of as representing "> -infinity".  Similarly, if such a skip
	 * array's low_compare is "a > 'foo'", then we position using "a > 'foo'"
	 * during the scan's initial call here; a lower-order key such as "b = 42"
	 * can't be used until the "a" array advances beyond MINVAL/low_compare.
	 *
	 * On the other hand, if such a skip array's low_compare was "a >= 'foo'",
	 * then we _can_ use "a >= 'foo' AND b = 42" during the initial call here.
	 * A subsequent call here might have us use "a = 'fop' AND b = 42".  Note
	 * that we treat = and >= as equivalent when scanning forwards (just as we
	 * treat = and <= as equivalent when scanning backwards).  We effectively
	 * do the same thing (though with a distinct "a" element/value) each time.
	 *
	 * All keys (with the exception of SK_SEARCHNULL keys and SK_BT_SKIP
	 * array keys whose array is "null_elem=true") imply a NOT NULL qualifier.
	 * If the index stores nulls at the end of the index we'll be starting
	 * from, and we have no boundary key for the column (which means the key
	 * we deduced NOT NULL from is an inequality key that constrains the other
	 * end of the index), then we cons up an explicit SK_SEARCHNOTNULL key to
	 * use as a boundary key.  If we didn't do this, we might find ourselves
	 * traversing a lot of null entries at the start of the scan.
	 *
	 * In this loop, row-comparison keys are treated the same as keys on their
	 * first (leftmost) columns.  We'll add all lower-order columns of the row
	 * comparison that were marked required during preprocessing below.
	 *
	 * _bt_advance_array_keys needs to know exactly how we'll reposition the
	 * scan (should it opt to schedule another primitive index scan).  It is
	 * critical that primscans only be scheduled when they'll definitely make
	 * some useful progress.  _bt_advance_array_keys does this by calling
	 * _bt_checkkeys routines that report whether a tuple is past the end of
	 * matches for the scan's keys (given the scan's current array elements).
	 * If the page's final tuple is "after the end of matches" for a scan that
	 * uses the *opposite* scan direction, then it must follow that it's also
	 * "before the start of matches" for the actual current scan direction.
	 * It is therefore essential that all of our initial positioning rules are
	 * symmetric with _bt_checkkeys's corresponding continuescan=false rule.
	 * If you update anything here, _bt_checkkeys/_bt_advance_array_keys might
	 * need to be kept in sync.
