	 * We need to calculate two parameters for the buffering algorithm:

	 *
	 * levelStep determines the size of subtree that we operate on, while
	 * emptying a buffer. A higher value is better, as you need fewer buffer
	 * emptying steps to build the index. However, if you set it too high, the
	 * subtree doesn't fit in cache anymore, and you quickly lose the benefit
	 * of the buffers.
	 *
	 * In Arge et al's paper, levelStep is chosen as logB(M/4B), where B is
	 * the number of tuples on page (ie. fanout), and M is the amount of
	 * internal memory available. Curiously, they doesn't explain *why* that
	 * setting is optimal. We calculate it by taking the highest levelStep so
	 * that a subtree still fits in cache. For a small B, our way of
	 * calculating levelStep is very close to Arge et al's formula. For a
	 * large B, our formula gives a value that is 2x higher.
	 *
	 * The average size (in pages) of a subtree of depth n can be calculated
	 * as a geometric series:
	 *
	 * B^0 + B^1 + B^2 + ... + B^n = (1 - B^(n + 1)) / (1 - B)
	 *
	 * where B is the average number of index tuples on page. The subtree is
	 * cached in the shared buffer cache and the OS cache, so we choose
	 * levelStep so that the subtree size is comfortably smaller than
	 * effective_cache_size, with a safety factor of 4.
	 *
	 * The estimate on the average number of index tuples on page is based on
	 * average tuple sizes observed before switching to buffered build, so the
	 * real subtree size can be somewhat larger. Also, it would selfish to
	 * gobble the whole cache for our index build. The safety factor of 4
	 * should account for those effects.
	 *
	 * The other limiting factor for setting levelStep is that while
	 * processing a subtree, we need to hold one page for each buffer at the
	 * next lower buffered level. The max. number of buffers needed for that
	 * is maxIndexTuplesPerPage^levelStep. This is very conservative, but
	 * hopefully maintenance_work_mem is set high enough that you're
	 * constrained by effective_cache_size rather than maintenance_work_mem.
	 *
	 * XXX: the buffer hash table consumes a fair amount of memory too per
	 * buffer, but that is not currently taken into account. That scales on
	 * the total number of buffers used, ie. the index size and on levelStep.
	 * Note that a higher levelStep *reduces* the amount of memory needed for
	 * the hash table.

 * we keep a stack of nodes visited when we descend the tree. However, in
 * buffering build, we can start descending the tree from any internal node,
 * when we empty a buffer by cascading tuples to its children. So we don't
 * have a full stack up to the root available at that time.
 *
 * So instead, we maintain a hash table to track the parent of every internal
 * page. We don't need to track the parents of leaf nodes, however. Whenever
 * we insert to a leaf, we've just descended down from its parent, so we know
 * its immediate parent already. This helps a lot to limit the memory used
 * by this hash table.
 *
 * Whenever an internal node is split, the parent map needs to be updated.
 * the parent of the new child page needs to be recorded, and also the
 * entries for all page whose downlinks are moved to a new page at the split
 * needs to be updated.
 *
 * We also update the parent map whenever we descend the tree. That might seem
 * unnecessary, because we maintain the map whenever a downlink is moved or
 * created, but it is needed because we switch to buffering mode after
 * creating a tree with regular index inserts. Any pages created before
 * switching to buffering mode will not be present in the parent map initially,
 * but will be added there the first time we visit them.
