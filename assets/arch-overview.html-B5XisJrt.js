This document describes the following two aspects of the PolarDB architecture in sequence: compute-storage separation and hybrid transactional/analytical processing (HTAP). You can find and read the content of your interest with ease.</p><ul><li>Compute-storage separation is the foundation of the PolarDB architecture. Conventional database systems run in the shared-nothing architecture, in which each instance is allocated independent computing resources and storage resources. As conventional database systems evolve towards compute-storage separation, database engines developers face challenges in managing executors, transactions, and buffers. PolarDB is designed to help you address these challenges.</li><li>HTAP is designed to support OLAP queries in OLTP scenarios and fully utilize the computing capabilities of multiple read-only nodes. HTAP is achieved by using a shared storage-based massively parallel processing (MPP) architecture. In the shared storage-based MPP architecture, each table or index tree is stored as a whole and is not divided into virtual partitions that are stored on different nodes. This way, you can retain the workflows used in OLTP scenarios. In addition, you can use the shared storage-based MPP architecture without the need to modify your application data.</li></ul><p>This section explains the following two aspects of the PolarDB architecture: compute-storage separation and HTAP.</p><h3 id="compute-storage-separation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#compute-storage-separation"><span>Compute-Storage Separation</span></a></h3><p><img src="'+y+'" alt="image.png"></p><p>PolarDB supports compute-storage separation. Each PolarDB cluster consists of a computing cluster and a storage cluster. You can flexibly scale out the computing cluster or the storage cluster based on your business requirements.</p><ol><li>If the computing power is insufficient, you can scale out only the computing cluster.</li><li>If the storage capacity is insufficient, you can scale out only the storage cluster.</li></ol><p>After the shared-storage architecture is used in PolarDB, the primary node and the read-only nodes share the same physical storage. If the primary node still uses the method that is used in conventional database systems to flush write-ahead logging (WAL) records, the following issues may occur.</p><ol><li>The pages that the read-only nodes read from the shared storage are outdated pages. Outdated pages are pages that are of earlier versions than the versions that are recorded on the read-only nodes.</li><li>The pages that the read-only nodes read from the shared storage are future pages. Future pages are pages that are of later versions than the versions that are recorded on the read-only nodes.</li><li>When your workloads are switched over from the primary node to a read-only node, the pages that the read-only node reads from the shared storage are outdated pages. In this case, the read-only node needs to read and apply WAL records to restore dirty pages.</li></ol><p>To resolve the first issue, PolarDB must support multiple versions for each page. To resolve the second issue, PolarDB must control the speed at which the primary node flushes WAL records.</p><h3 id="htap" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#htap"><span>HTAP</span></a></h3><p>When read/write splitting is enabled, each individual compute node cannot fully utilize the high I/O throughput that is provided by the shared storage. In addition, you cannot accelerate large queries by adding computing resources. To resolve these issues, PolarDB uses the shared storage-based MPP architecture to accelerate OLAP queries in OLTP scenarios.</p><p>PolarDB supports a complete suite of data types that are used in OLTP scenarios. PolarDB also supports two computing engines, which can process these types of data:</p><ul><li>Standalone execution engine: processes highly concurrent OLTP queries.</li><li>Distributed execution engine: processes large OLAP queries.</li></ul><p><img src="'+b+'" alt="image.png"></p><p>When the same hardware resources are used, PolarDB delivers performance that is 90% of the performance delivered by traditional MPP database. PolarDB also provides SQL statement-level scalability. If the computing power of your PolarDB cluster is insufficient, you can allocate more CPU resources to OLAP queries without the need to rearrange data.</p><p>The following sections provide more details about compute-storage separation and HTAP.</p><h2 id="polardb-compute-storage-separation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#polardb-compute-storage-separation"><span>PolarDB: Compute-Storage Separation</span></a></h2><h3 id="challenges-of-shared-storage" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#challenges-of-shared-storage"><span>Challenges of Shared Storage</span></a></h3><p>Compute-storage separation enables the compute nodes of your PolarDB cluster to share the same physical storage.

When you query the page on the read-only nodes, the read-only nodes read the page from the shared storage. As a result, only the previous version of the page is returned. This previous version is called an outdated page. The following figure shows more details.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="image.png"></p><ol><li>At T1, the primary node writes a WAL record with a log sequence number (LSN) of 200 to the memory to update Page 1 from version 500 to version 600.</li><li>At T1, Page 1 on the read-only nodes is in version 500.</li><li>At T2, the primary node sends the metadata of WAL Record 200 to the read-only nodes to notify the read-only nodes of a new WAL record.</li><li>At T3, you query Page 1 on the read-only nodes.

However, the memory capacity of each read-only node is limited. Therefore, these inverted indexes must be persistently stored. To meet this requirement, PolarDB provides LogIndex. LogIndex is an index structure, which is used to persistently store hash data.</p><ol><li>The WAL receiver processes of the read-only nodes receive the metadata of WAL records from the primary node.</li><li>The metadata of each WAL record contains information about which page is updated.</li><li>The read-only nodes insert the metadata of each WAL record into a LogIndex structure to generate a LogIndex record.

The following figure shows more details.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="image.png"></p><ol><li>At T1, the primary node updates Page 1 twice from version 500 to version 700. Two WAL records are generated during the update process. The LSN of one WAL record is 200, and the LSN of the other WAL record is 300. At this time, Page 1 is still in version 500 on the primary node and the read-only nodes.</li><li>At T2, the primary node sends WAL Record 200 to the read-only nodes.</li><li>At T3, the read-only nodes apply WAL Record 200 to update Page 1 to version 600. At this time, the read-only nodes have not read or applied WAL Record 300.</li><li>At T4, the primary node writes version 700 of Page 1 to the shared storage. At the same time, Page 1 is removed from the buffer pools of the read-only nodes.</li><li>At T5, the read-only nodes attempt to read Page 1 again. Page 1 cannot be found in the buffer pools of the read-only nodes. Therefore, the read-only nodes obtain version 700 of Page 1 from the shared storage. Version 700 of Page 1 is a future page to the read-only nodes because the read-only nodes have not read or applied WAL Record 300.</li><li>If some of the pages that the read-only nodes obtain from the shared storage are future pages and some are normal pages, data inconsistencies may occur.

These operations are offloaded to multiple user processes.</li></ol><p>This optimization method significantly reduces the log apply latency and increases the log apply speed by 30 times compared with Amazon Aurora.</p><p><img src="'+x+'" alt="image.png"></p><h4 id="optimization-method-3-optimize-the-log-apply-of-ddl-locks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#optimization-method-3-optimize-the-log-apply-of-ddl-locks"><span>Optimization Method 3: Optimize the Log Apply of DDL Locks</span></a></h4><p>When the primary node runs a DDL operation such as DROP TABLE to modify a table, the primary node acquires an exclusive DDL lock on the table. The exclusive DDL lock is replicated to the read-only nodes along with WAL records. The read-only nodes apply the WAL records to acquire the exclusive DDL lock on the table. This ensures that the table cannot be deleted by the primary node when a read-only node is reading the table. Only one copy of the table is stored in the shared storage.</p><p>When the applying process of a read-only node applies the exclusive DDL lock, the read-only node may require a long period of time to acquire the exclusive DDL lock on the table. You can optimize the critical path of the log apply process by offloading the task of acquiring the exclusive DDL lock to other processes.</p><p><img src="'+B+'" alt="image.png"></p><p>This optimization method ensures that the critical path of the log apply process of a read-only node is not blocked even if the log apply process needs to wait for the release of an exclusive DDL lock.</p><p><img src="'+S+'" alt="image.png"></p><p>The three optimization methods in combination significantly reduce replication latency and have the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Read/write splitting: Loads are balanced, which allows PolarDB to deliver user experience that is comparable to Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC).</li><li>High availability: The time that is required for failover is reduced.</li><li>Stability: The number of future pages is minimized, and fewer or even no page snapshots need to be taken.</li></ul><h3 id="recovery-optimization" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#recovery-optimization"><span>Recovery Optimization</span></a></h3><h4 id="background-information" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#background-information"><span>Background Information</span></a></h4><p>If the read-only nodes apply WAL records at low speeds, your PolarDB cluster may require a long period of time to recover from exceptions such as out of memory (OOM) errors and unexpected crashes.

In general, the recovery process of the primary node after a restart is the same as the process in which the read-only nodes apply WAL records. In this sense, the lazy log apply mode can also be used to accelerate the recovery of the primary node.</p><p><img src="'+W+'" alt="image.png"></p><ol><li>The primary node begins to apply WAL records in lazy log apply mode one by one starting from a specific checkpoint.</li><li>After the primary node applies all LogIndex records, the log apply is complete.</li><li>After the recovery is complete, the primary node starts to run.</li><li>The actual log apply workloads are offloaded to the session process that is started after the primary node restarts.</li></ol><p>The example in the following figure shows how the optimized recovery method significantly reduces the time that is required to apply 500 MB of WAL records.</p><p><img src="'+I+'" alt="image.png"></p><h4 id="persistent-buffer-pool" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#persistent-buffer-pool"><span>Persistent Buffer Pool</span></a></h4><p>After the primary node recovers, a session process may need to apply the pages that the session process reads. When a session process is applying pages, the primary node responds at low speeds for a short period of time. To resolve this issue, PolarDB does not delete pages from the buffer pool of the primary node if the primary node restarts or unexpectedly crashes.</p><p><img src="'+z+'" alt="image.png"></p><p>The shared memory of the database engine consists of the following two parts:</p><ol><li>One part is used to store global structures and ProcArray structures.</li><li>The other part is used to store buffer pool structures. The buffer pool is allocated as a specific amount of named shared memory. Therefore, the buffer pool remains valid after the primary node restarts. However, global structures need to be reinitialized after the primary node restarts.</li></ol><p><img src="'+C+'" alt="image.png"></p><p>Not all pages in the buffer pool of the primary node can be reused. For example, if a process acquires an exclusive lock on a page before the primary node restarts and then unexpectedly crashes, no other processes can release the exclusive lock on the page. Therefore, after the primary node unexpectedly crashes or restarts, it needs to traverse all pages in its buffer pool to identify and remove the pages that cannot be reused. In addition, the recycling of buffer pools depends on Kubernetes.</p><p>This optimized buffer pool mechanism ensures the stable performance of your PolarDB cluster before and after a restart.</p><p><img src="'+O+'" alt="image.png"></p><h2 id="polardb-htap" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#polardb-htap"><span>PolarDB HTAP</span></a></h2><p>The shared storage of PolarDB is organized as a storage pool. When read/write splitting is enabled, the theoretical I/O throughput that is supported by the shared storage is infinite. However, large queries can be run only on individual compute nodes, and the CPU, memory, and I/O specifications of a single compute node are limited. Therefore, a single compute node cannot fully utilize the high I/O throughput that is supported by the shared storage or accelerate large queries by acquiring more computing resources. To resolve these issues, PolarDB uses the shared storage-based MPP architecture to accelerate OLAP queries in OLTP scenarios.</p><h3 id="basic-principles-of-htap" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#basic-principles-of-htap"><span>Basic Principles of HTAP</span></a></h3><p>In a PolarDB cluster, the physical storage is shared among all compute nodes. Therefore, you cannot use the method of scanning tables in conventional MPP databases to scan tables in PolarDB clusters. PolarDB supports MPP on standalone execution engines and provides optimized shared storage. This shared storage-based MPP architecture is the first architecture of its kind in the industry. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with following basic principles of this architecture before you use PolarDB:</p><ol><li>The Shuffle operator masks the data distribution.</li><li>The ParallelScan operator masks the shared storage.</li></ol><p><img src="'+q+'" alt="image.png"></p><p>The preceding figure shows an example.</p><ol><li>Table A and Table B are joined and aggregated.</li><li>Table A and Table B are still individual tables in the shared storage. These tables are not physically partitioned.</li><li>Four types of scan operators are redesigned to scan tables in the shared storage as virtual partitions.</li></ol><h3 id="distributed-optimizer" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#distributed-optimizer"><span>Distributed Optimizer</span></a></h3><p>The GPORCA optmizer is extended to provide a set of transformation rules that can recognize shared storage. The GPORCA optimizer enables PolarDB to access a specific amount of planned search space. For example, PolarDB can scan a table as a whole or as different virtual partitions. This is a major difference between shared storage-based MPP and conventional MPP.</p><p>The modules in gray in the upper part of the following figure are modules of the database engine. These modules enable the database engine of PolarDB to adapt to the GPORCA optimizer.</p><p>The modules in the lower part of the following figure comprise the GPORCA optimizer. Among these modules, the modules in gray are extended modules, which enable the GPORCA optimizer to communicate with the shared storage of PolarDB.</p><p><img src="'+Q+'" alt="image.png"></p><h3 id="parallelism-of-operators" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#parallelism-of-operators"><span>Parallelism of Operators</span></a></h3><p>Four types of operators in PolarDB require parallelism. This section describes how to enable parallelism for operators that are used to run sequential scans. To fully utilize the I/O throughput that is supported by the shared storage, PolarDB splits each table into logical units during a sequential scan. Each unit contains 4 MB of data. This way, PolarDB can distribute I/O loads to different disks, and the disks can simultaneously scan data to accelerate the sequential scan. In addition, each read-only node needs to scan only specific tables rather than all tables. The size of tables that can be cached is the total size of the buffer pools of all read-only nodes.</p><p><img src="'+H+'" alt="image.png"></p><p>Parallelism has the following benefits, as shown in the following figure:</p><ol><li>You can increase scan performance by 30 times by creating read-only nodes.</li><li>You can reduce the time that is required for a scan from 37 minutes to 3.75 seconds by enabling the buffering feature.</li></ol><p><img src="'+M+'" alt="image.png"></p><h3 id="solve-the-issue-of-data-skew" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#solve-the-issue-of-data-skew"><span>Solve the Issue of Data Skew</span></a></h3><p>Data skew is a common issue in conventional MPP:</p><ol><li>In PolarDB, large objects reference TOAST tables by using heap tables.

In addition, the context of each operator is stored in the private memory of the worker threads. The coordinator node does not store the information about specific tables.</p><p>In the example shown in the following table, PolarDB uses static sharding to shard large objects. During the static sharding process, data skew occurs, but the performance of dynamic scanning can still linearly increase.</p><p><img src="'+G+'" alt="image.png"></p><h2 id="sql-statement-level-scalability" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sql-statement-level-scalability"><span>SQL Statement-level Scalability</span></a></h2><p>Data sharing helps deliver ultimate scalability in cloud-native environments. The full path of the coordinator node involves various modules, and PolarDB can store the external dependencies of these modules to the shared storage. In addition, the full path of a worker thread involves a number of operational parameters, and PolarDB can synchronize these parameters from the coordinator node over the control path. This way, the coordinator node and the worker thread are stateless.</p><p><img src="'+N+'" alt="image.png"></p><p>The following conclusions are made based on the preceding analysis:</p><ol><li>All read-only nodes that run SQL joins can function as coordinator nodes. Therefore, the performance of PolarDB is no longer limited due to the availability of only a single coordinator node.</li><li>Each SQL statement can start any number of worker threads on any compute node.
