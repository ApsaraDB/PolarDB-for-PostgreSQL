# The PostgreSQL make files exploit features of GNU make that other
# makes do not have. Because it is a common mistake for users to try
# to build Postgres with a different make, we have this make file
# that, as a service, will look for a GNU make and invoke it, or show
# an error message if none could be found.

# If the user were using GNU make now, this file would not get used
# because GNU make uses a make file named "GNUmakefile" in preference
# to "Makefile" if it exists. PostgreSQL is shipped with a
# "GNUmakefile". If the user hasn't run the configure script yet, the
# GNUmakefile won't exist yet, so we catch that case as well.


# AIX make defaults to building *every* target of the first rule.  Start with
# a single-target, empty rule to make the other targets non-default.
# (We don't support AIX anymore, but if someone tries to build on AIX anyway,
# at least they'll get the instructions to run 'configure' first.)
