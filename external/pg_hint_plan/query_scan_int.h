 *	  lexical scanner internal declarations
 *
 * This file declares the QueryScanStateData structure used by query_scan.l.
 *
 * One difficult aspect of this code is that we need to work in multibyte
 * encodings that are not ASCII-safe.  A "safe" encoding is one in which each
 * byte of a multibyte character has the high bit set (it's >= 0x80).  Since
 * all our lexing rules treat all high-bit-set characters alike, we don't
 * really need to care whether such a byte is part of a sequence or not.
 * In an "unsafe" encoding, we still expect the first byte of a multibyte
 * sequence to be >= 0x80, but later bytes might not be.  If we scan such
 * a sequence as-is, the lexing rules could easily be fooled into matching
 * such bytes to ordinary ASCII characters.  Our solution for this is to
 * substitute 0xFF for each non-first byte within the data presented to flex.
 * The flex rules will then pass the FF's through unmolested.  The
 * query_scan_emit() subroutine is responsible for looking back to the
 * original string and replacing FF's with the corresponding original bytes.
 *
 * Another interesting thing we do here is scan different parts of the same
 * input with physically separate flex lexers (ie, lexers written in separate
 * .l files).  We can get away with this because the only part of the
 * persistent state of a flex lexer that depends on its parsing rule tables
 * is the start state number, which is easy enough to manage --- usually,
 * in fact, we just need to set it to INITIAL when changing lexers.  But to
 * make that work at all, we must use re-entrant lexers, so that all the
 * relevant state is in the yyscan_t attached to the QueryScanState;
 * if we were using lexers with separate static state we would soon end up
 * with dangling buffer pointers in one or the other.  Also note that this
 * is unlikely to work very nicely if the lexers aren't all built with the
 * same flex version, or if they don't use the same flex options.
